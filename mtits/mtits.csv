","The safety of intersections on a major corridor is always a concern because of the high-risk vehicle maneuvers intertwined with high operating speed. Significant number of crashes at such intersections is angled-collisions with a high percentage of fatalities and injuries. This is especially true at intersections with a two-way stop-sign control (TWSC) where vehicles on a low-speed, minor roadway must cross or merge into the path of high-speed vehicles on the major highway. The crashes often involve a vehicle entering the intersection from the stop approach and a vehicle travelling high speed on the main approach. While sign and pavement marking may have an impact, they are not considered as effective as eliminating the through and left-turn movement from the minor street. For a signalized four-leg (4SG) intersection, an exclusive left-turn signal phase does promote safety, but it often results in a lower intersection capacity and the excessive delay, particularly during rush hours. One relatively new countermeasure, called Restricted Crossing U-turn (RCUT) has gained significant interest.The RCUT is aimed to reduce the number of conflicting point (thus, reducing crashes and crash severity) and increase intersection capacity. Left-turning and crossing vehicles on the minor road are forced to turn right at the intersection and then making a U-turn a short distance away. Clearly, the RCUT is suitable for an intersection of a major arterial and a minor roadway with significantly smaller traffic volume This paper evaluates the safety benefit of six RCUTs in Louisiana. Unlike the previous studies, this investigation covers both the RCUT intersection only and RCUT system (consisting of the intersection, two U-turns and segments in between). The crash analysis shows a 100% reduction in fatalities, 41.5% in injuries and 22.3% in property damage only crash for the RCUT intersection only, and less impressive reductions for the RCUT system. The review of the original crash reports greatly benefits the investigation on why the crashes increased at few locations, thus, provides the valuable information on how to correct these crash problems through the detailed design and traffic control. The safety improvement plus the high ratio of benefit to cost strongly demonstrate that the RCUT is an effective and economically justified countermeasure on high-speed roadways in both rural and urban areas.",,MK,,,2018-09-07 19:17,0/0,,Nowy

","According to the results of the conducted research, for the first time in the most comprehensive and generalized form, discovered the existence of an analogy between the electrical parameters and the functional dependencies of process for the electric circuit and the traffic flow on the urban road network. On the base of these analogies, the electrical analogue model of analysis and optimization of traffic flows operation on the city's road network is proposed. According to the proposed model, the structure of the road network is representing as a scheme of a branched electric circuit of direct current. In this scheme, each section of the road network is representing by consistent connection of the diode and the resistor. This in general, for the electrical circuit, will reflect the parameters of the configuration of the structural elements of the road network and the features of the road network implementation of the scheme of road traffic organization. Within the framework of this model it is possible to optimize the functioning of traffic flows in the city's road network. Optimization is achieving by redistributing traffic flows in the city's road network in order to unload congested sections to ensure a more complete and even loading of the urban road network in general. Here, the objective function of optimizing traffic flows is to maximize the capacity of the city's road network, which depends on the level of loading of its sections. The task of increasing the capacity of the city's road network is the classical optimization task with respect to the maximum flow of the urban road network due to redistribution of the levels of loading of its sections. Carrying out such an optimization using the electrical analogue model is an important component for determining the conditions of a rational organization of the functioning of traffic flows in cities. The proposed electrical-engineering analogue model can become an important tool for analyzing the operation of traffic flows within the city's ITS. In particular, its use will allow for the solution of such major interrelated tasks as: - determination of the load of road networks of cities (establishment of distribution of traffic flows according to the intensity of traffic flows on sections of the road network, including taking into account the estimation for filling the network with traffic flows); - detecting of the section of the streets and roads with excessive traffic load and development of a set of measures aimed at its elimination; - optimizing of the parameters of the traffic light control cycle on the sections of the road network with excessive traffic loads; - estimating of the efficiency of investing in projects for the development of a road network (identification and implementation of priority projects); - develop of measures to reduce the negative impact of road transport in urban areas on the natural environment.",,VN,,,2018-10-01 14:12,0/0,,Nowy

","Short-term traffic forecasting is an emerging problem in transportation engineering that attracts significant academic attention over past decades. Recently the methodological focus shifted from non-spatial time series to spatiotemporal models that utilize both spatial and temporal relationships of traffic flows. In this paper we suggest linking spatiotemporal traffic forecasting to a video inpainting problem (reconstruction of lost or deteriorated parts of a video stream). Similarly to traffic flows, a video stream has a spatiotemporal structure (temporal sequence of two-dimensional frames), and its inpainting can be considered as forecasting of missing parts on the base of surrounding parts in current and previous frames. A wide range of fast and efficient algorithms (regression-based, neural networks, tensor decomposition, etc.) is developed for video inpainting, and direct application of these algorithms will allow enhancing the traffic forecasting toolbox. The most challenging part of inpainting algorithms' application for traffic forecasting is identification of a spatiotemporal structure (dependencies between traffic flows in space and time). For a regular video stream, this structure is naturally defined by smoothness of transitions - a sequence of video frames determines the temporal dimension and Euclidean neighborhood determines spatial dimensions. For traffic flows, identification of the spatiotemporal structure is not straightforward and depends on temporal resolution, structure of a road network and even on drivers' routing preferences. In this study we utilized two approaches to spatiotemporal structure identification: topological and correlation-based. Within the topological approach, a space-time neighborhood is defined on the base of road connectivity and travel times between analyzed road segments. Within the correlation-based approach, the spatiotemporal structure is estimated using cross-correlations of traffic flows at analyzed road segments, regularized by the graphical lasso algorithm. Given the spatiotemporal structure, we applied a novel regression-based video inpainting method for forecasting of traffic volumes. A peculiarity of the utilized method lays in feature engineering for better specification of spatiotemporal neighborhood dynamics in local multiple regression models. The suggested approach was cross-validated for a large-scale traffic data set, collected from the performance measurement system (PeMS) for Minneapolis, US. Good observed forecasting performance supports our main research hypothesis on utility of merging video inpainting and spatiotemporal traffic forecasting problems. Using two different spatiotemporal structures (topological and correlation-based), we also made preliminary conclusions on their importance for traffic flow forecasting. In addition, we illustrated that the suggested approach is also useful for solving another emerging traffic modelling problems – imputation of missed traffic flow data for internal road segments.","We don't provide bibliographic references in short abstracts, but there are a couple of sources that could be useful for better understand of our research.

","This study is motivated by the recent accomplishments demonstrated by OpenAI in which they showcased their abilities during a complex real-time (video) game. Using reinforcement-learning techniques, the AI developed (its own) strategies, which were able to defeat (semi-)professional players using simplified rules. After removing some of the restrictions, it demonstrated great potential. Nevertheless, it would need additional training in the new, more realistic environment. Transfer to mobility sector: we assume a framework, where an AI “plays (autonomous) mobility-on-demand (AMoD) operator”. Simplified frameworks might be good for initial training; however, it will be necessary to have a realistic simulation framework in order to create the necessary amount of training and testing scenarios for a fleet-operating AI. Otherwise, an operator will probably not be able to deploy it efficiently in a real-life environment. Previous research studied AMoD operating policies in a “round-based game” framework in which the simulation clock stops whenever the operator computes its actions in a decision time step. Additionally, all interactions between users and the operator are assumed instantaneous, and all users are assumed to be on time and no-shows are not considered. However, these assumptions do not represent reality. Consequently, a real AMoD operator has to consider additional details, which might affect fleet performance. The presented real-time gaming framework will identify many required modifications to a policy that was developed for a round-based framework, e.g. the following examples: • It will probably show that it is beneficial for an operator to make decisions based on a forecast of the state after the computation of decisions rather than the state of the beginning of the decision time step. • Since users probably want to have an offer including estimated pick-up time and price, the operator has to decide whether it uses some kind of dynamic algorithm to estimate these values or include the users in the current optimization. Either way, the operator has to decide if it is meaningful to send a vehicle in the user’s direction even if the contract is not yet confirmed. The presented framework includes a (probably uncalibrated) real-time user decision model, which can consider multiple AMoD operators, as well as a transit operator based on GTFS data. In this framework, users request real-time offers in order to decide which AMoD or transit operator they will choose. Furthermore, the implementation of a “last-mile AMoD operator”, which needs to compute multi-modal routes, will either be shown or delineated. The framework is created in a modular fashion with an interface to a routing engine, which allows a rather simple transfer of the framework to different cities or different network definitions, e.g. a plane map, OSRM, or routing code written by the software user. The framework code (including a few simple operator models, maps and NYC taxi requests) will be made available via github as part of the publication. We encourage other researchers and (A)MoD operators to test their own operating policies and engage in discussion about possible extensions of the framework.","Even though an AI operating policyis the motivation for the new framework, this paper focuses on the framework and an AI implementaiton will not be part of the presented work.",RK,TAK,"Very interesting concept, with number of threads.

","Surrogate measures of safety attract revived interest thanks to the advancements in traffic observations techniques and the growing need for rapid safety evaluation. This paper briefly introduces the latest method of analyzing traffic conflicts caused by some sort of failures to estimate the expected frequency of crashes. It can be applied to conventional and autonomous vehicles. The Lomax distribution of drivers’ response delays to failures is derived from the causality mechanism with application of the counterfactual approach. The Lomax distribution belongs to the family of extreme value (exceedance version) distributions. The proposed method delivers a consistent and logical framework, intuitive interpretation of the results and conceptually sound and practical way of setting a proper threshold separation between conflicting road users to address the primary concern among traffic conflict experts and users. From this perspective, the proposed method is less restrictive and more appealing than the early proposed extreme value distributions. The fundamentals of the method are briefly explained and an example application to analyzing road departures in a driving simulator presented. The results confirm the expectations derived from the concept of the method. The paper also discusses an application of the method to analyze safety of autonomous vehicles. The data needed for the analysis and expected to be collected in autonomous vehicles are identified. The envisioned applications include estimating the crash probability to better interpret the gravity of near-crash situations experienced by autonomous vehicles, optimization of navigation system’s response to threat by minimizing the crash probability, and identifying and estimating the risk factors among others. Directions of future development and evaluation are discussed to effectively implement the method to the current and near-future safety engineering practice.","This paper may be presented at a special session on traffic safety organized by Mariusz Kiec.

","Sustainability is nowadays an overarching concept for transport policy and planning around the world. Among the different definitions of “sustainable transport” that can be found in the related literature, a valuable one has been provided by the European Council, stating that ‘A sustainable transport system is one that is accessible, safe, environmentally-friendly, and affordable.’ On September 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted a set of 17 sustainable development goals as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 11 is dedicated to cities: “make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. The New Urban Agenda approved in Quito in October 2016 at the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) also focuses on both sustainable transportation and sustainable urban development. In effect, focusing on urban areas, the problem of congestion combined with the need to reduce emissions into the atmosphere and increase road safety to support so-called “soft mobility” (i.e., the mobility of pedestrians, cyclists) has led national and European administrations to develop solutions that provide valid alternative to private transport. Among these, the construction of paths and areas dedicated to pedestrians can be a solution to be adopted to discourage motorized transport. For this reason, it is necessary to develop solutions that can allow an optimization of the management and organization of pedestrian networks. Improving urban pedestrianism, as well as generating a direct and positive effect on the transport organization, is also an opportunity for redeveloping the city and increasing tourist flows. Given this premise, the aim of this paper consists of analysing the future trend of mobility and of modelling the interaction between urban space and urban mobility, in particular the relation between autonomous vehicles and urban space. In specific, simplified flow-cost functions able to consider mixed traditional-autonomous vehicular flows is applied with the aim of evaluating the impacts automation on the existing infrastructure in particular to see which links are superfluous and then be able to eliminate them to reuse them for the soft mobility. Although the proposed approach makes quit strong assumption, the findings achievable with the proposed approach are useful for public administration to understand the future needs of their cities and define new policies required to support the urban change.

","Future IVI navigation systems will increasingly affect the operation of semi-automated and highly automated driving. With the standardization in the ETSI standard, the current vehicle positioning is transmitted within the Cooperative Awerness Message (CAM). This laid the foundation for referencing the surrounding vehicle objects. The acquisition of the current position is based on conventional GNSS solutions. High deviations in the urban area due to multipath effects, inaccuracies in the receiver clocks as well as due to atmospheric effects make possible deviations, which have to be compensated by additional sensors. In addition, within the message format, no statement is made about the mounting position of the receiver, which increases the statistical uncertainty with increasing the vehicle length. Due to the currently low prevalence of the Car2X systems and the uncertainties mentioned, object detection on the sole basis of Car2X technology is unsustainable. Previous object detection applications are based on sensor data fusion of cameras, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and / or Radar. The use of a single sensor thus decimates the confidence in the result. Thie paper on hand introduces a method that enables the detection and tracking of vehicle objects based on Car2X information and a LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR is mounted on a test carrier and detects its environment with a horizontal opening angle of 360 ° and a vertical opening angle of 30 °. Per se, the LiDAR is the sensor with the highest accuracy, but with increasing distance and the resulting minimization of the object-relevant backscatter pulse, the security and integrity of object detection reducedes. At the same time, object properties such as surface texture, defined in color and gloss, relative orientation and atmospheric properties affect the backscatter intensity of the LiDAR. The paper introduces an approach that improves the integrity of object recognition based on the LiDAR and Car2X systems. For this purpose, the properties of the objects mentioned in terms of their influence are examined. The results are mapped in a model. On the basis of knowledge, the approach to multi-sensor data fusion is presented. Further, the results from the work are compared with current standard of technology. In addition, proposals for the extension of the current ETSI standards will be derived and defined as a message format. With the anticipated improved object recognition from the approach, relevant objects are detected sooner and with a higher accuracy. The approach thus contributes decisively to improving the traffic safety and also offers potential for further applications.",,VN,,,2018-10-08 13:18,0/0,,Nowy

","Automated and connected vehicles will change transport supply and in consequence influence travel demand. Especially fully automated vehicles can have a major impact as carsharing and ridesharing systems become more attractive. For evaluating impacts of changes in transport supply, many cities and regions operate macroscopic travel demand models. For them it would be helpful to supplement these models in a way that enables the testing of scenarios including fleets of shared automated vehicles. This paper focuses on how to integrate ridesharing services provided by fully automated vehicles into macroscopic travel demand models. This needs to consider that ridesharing can be used in two ways: (1) Direct ridesharing, where ridesharing is the only mode for the entire trip. (2) Intermodal ridesharing, where ridesharing acts as a feeder system for the first/last mile of a combined trip with public transport. For direct trips, this paper proposes to add ridesharing as an independent mode. To model ridesharing as feeder for public transport the paper examines two approaches. (1) The first approach includes ridesharing as an additional transport system, which is considered in a timetable-based public transport assignment. The departure time of a ridesharing vehicle is directly derived from the departure times of trains and busses provided by the timetable. As routing models with a more or less unlimited number of access and egress links between traffic zones and all possible stop locations are computational demanding, a second simplified approach is developed. (2) In the second approach, the ridesharing feeder trip legs are modeled as direct links between traffic zones and suitable public transport transfer stops. This limits the number of options for the routing procedure. Using the network of the second approach as an input the travel demand is computed with a mode choice model containing the four modes walking, cycling, direct ridesharing and public transport with integrated ridesharing. After this step, the public transport demand is assigned to the network, thus determining the demand for feeder trips. Then all person trip legs using direct and intermodal ridesharing are bundled to vehicle trips using a trip-bundling algorithm. Finally, the vehicle trips are concatenated to vehicle tours resulting in empty trips for vehicle reallocation. The resulting vehicle matrix is then assigned to the network. The second approach was implemented in the travel demand model of the Stuttgart region. The tested scenario prohibits private car ownership and offers collective ridesharing instead. This means that travelers have to share a vehicle, taking into account certain limits for maximum vehicle detours and extensions of travel time. Furthermore, the public transport bus system is assumed to be replaced by ridesharing. First results of this scenario show that the number of cars needed can be reduced to less than 25% of the number of cars needed today. The vehicle kilometers travelled however, decrease only slightly as current car trips have a limited potential to be bundled to ridesharing trips, bus trips are replaced by car trips and empty trips are necessary to reallocate the sharing vehicles.",,MB,,,2018-10-08 13:48,0/0,,Nowy

","The condition of railway infrastructure plays a fundamental role in railway transportation availability, reliability and safety and this implies the need of carefully planning asset management activities. One of the main benefits of the digital transformation is the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the Asset Management process through data-driven risk-aware decision support systems, leveraging the possibility to exploit data transforming them into knowledge, thus paving the road towards an Intelligent Asset Management System (IAMS). Therefore, innovative approaches for the development of a decision support system able to exploit the available data are needed. Works that deal with data analytics in the rail sector are present in literature, but the integration of these techniques, within a decision support system for the IAMS, seems not yet exploited. The paper describes the whole IAMS decisional process based on a real railway signalling use case: from field data acquisition to decision support. The process includes data collection, preparation and analytics to extract knowledge on asset status, supporting predictive maintenance. Finally, within the decision support system, a prioritization of asset management interventions is performed, by applying risk-based logics and operational constraints. The target is to optimize the scheduling of predictive maintenance activities, to minimize service disruption risk and optimize both usage of resources and possession times, avoiding contractual penalties and delays. In this context, a real use case related to signalling system and, in particular, to track circuits, is presented. One of the main issues related to track circuits is the false track occupancy phenomena, which means that the track is erroneously considered in occupied state, due to malfunctions or external conditions that may affect the correct behaviour. The false track occupancy is a critical failure for the railway line because it has relevant consequences for trains circulation, since this event usually implies the reduction of service quality. The presented approach has implemented asset status monitoring, anomaly detection and asset status forecasting methodologies using as input heterogeneous data, such as track circuit shunt level voltage and traffic and weather information. The main benefits of the approach are: an earlier/timely identification and correction of critical defects; the mitigation of risks of critical defect occurrence; the efficient usage of track access times, thus increasing track availability; optimized Asset Management plans based on the correct estimation of current and future infrastructure conditions. The applicability of the proposed methodology to an Italian urban rail network is described and the usefulness of the approach and its possible further developments are presented.

","In line with the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, more and more countries tend to foster sustainable actions, such as the development of innovative and intelligent transportation systems. In particular the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) are viewed as an environmental friendly initiative and an economic opportunity since the number of EVs in the globe would be over 35 million by 2022, and EVs sales per year in U.S. would reach 2.4 million by 2024. In the urban context, the use of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) is steadily increasing, because, as compared to Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles and despite higher purchasing costs, the operational costs for BEVs are nearly four times lower than diesel vehicles. The use of EVs is highly relying on the availability of effective charging infrastructures whether public or private. Some recharging terminals are nowadays available at refueling stations. In the frame of freight distribution, the owners of EVs usually charge their vehicles at the depot overnight. However, planning the routes of electric vehicles for timely delivery of goods, involves to take into account the limited range of the batteries which may lead to detours for recharging purposes. In this work, the studied vehicles are modular. It means that they consist of an innovative system with one cabin module where the driver sits and one or more payload modules for the freight. The main advantage of this configuration is that the payload modules can be detached when necessary, for instance to overcome length restrictions in too narrow streets or for energy purpose. If a recharging terminal is available at a customer location, one of the modules can recharge its battery whereas the rest of the vehicle continues its tour. The vehicle which will later pick up this module will benefit from the additional electric charge. The payload modules can be dropped off also to enable the rest of the vehicle saving time and respecting the delays to deliver the customers. The research problem arising when routing such a fleet of electric modular vehicles is relatively new. It extends the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) in the sense that its objective is to minimize the total routing costs while taking into consideration the time windows for serving the customers, the capacity of the vehicles but also the modular property of the vehicles and the recharging constraints. This problem was already formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program and solved with different metaheuristic algorithms which showed their relative effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an enhanced method that exploits the best optimization strategies currently dedicated to the VRPTW and its variants, namely a combination between evolutionary methods and local search procedures. More precisely, the evolutionary schema, which has the major advantage to be population based, is hybridized with two possible procedures: a local search operator and a variable neighborhood descent. An experimental study is conducted to compare the two approaches.",,MB,,,2018-10-09 15:45,0/0,,Nowy

","By installing Bluetooth sensors at a specific set of intersections it is possible to detect the passage of vehicles equipped with Bluetooth technology by these points. However, Bluetooth-enabled vehicles are not necessarily detected by every sensor they pass by, because the probability of detection depends on several factors, such as weather, nearby infrastructure, or the speed of the vehicle. To address this lack of perfect information, this study describes a methodology to infer the most likely route used by a vehicle between two successive detections. The methodology consists of three stages. The first stage entails drawing up a graph of the road network and the location of Bluetooth sensors. The second stage consists of using the Bluetooth-acquired data to calibrate the distribution of dwell time at each node and travel time for each edge of the graph defined in Stage 1. The third and final stage consists of convoluting node and edge time distributions between successive detections to obtain an aggregate distribution for each potential route. A Bayesian inference is then applied based on the travel time observed for each vehicle and the set of detections that did not occur, to determine the probability of each route. This methodology is tested using microsimulations and has shown a prediction performance over 90% in all the scenarios tried. We compared this methodology with another methodology described in the literature. While the prediction percentage of both methodologies is similar, the results of the proposed methodology prove to be better when the network’s sensory density is low and data available are reduced.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-10 00:53,0/0,,Nowy

","The majority of behavioural studies in the domain of public transport have used stated preferences to estimate choice parameters. However, as more transportation networks turn to using smart cards for fare collection, an increasing number of studies are making use of these revealed preferences for route choice estimations. The use of such revealed preferences has a number of advantages over stated behaviour. However, since in revealed preferences, the data only describes the choices made and not the alternatives, a route choice set has to be generated for each origin-destination (OD) pair. A common method, typically used with smart card data, is to assume the set of all observed routes between OD pairs as their respective route choice sets. However, notwithstanding data collection duration requirements, this assumption has several issues. First, generating route choice sets from direct observations may preclude the possibility of analysing why some non-chosen but feasible routes are never selected. Moreover, the transferability of behaviour parameters, estimated with choice sets thus obtained, is precarious because there is no matching choice set generation methodology available for other networks. At the opposite spectrum of this data-driven approach is the link labelling approach which explicitly takes into account behaviour but depends on analyst judgements for the initial label set definitions. To overcome the shortcomings of data-driven approaches and offer an alternative approach to include behaviour in route choice set generation models with fewer assumptions, a two-step methodology is proposed. First, considering only the topological properties of the network (lines as a sequence of stations), a master choice set is generated with a constrained enumeration method that uses a breadth-first search. Breadth-wise constraints are based on a set of logical rules (e.g., a traveller does not visit the same stop more than once) and the depth is constrained by a feasibility constraint that restricts the maximum number of transfers. This results in a choice set matrix with a large number of alternatives per OD pair. Attribute values are assigned to alternatives in a choice set as factors of the respective smallest attribute value present in that set. Second, behavioural parameters are added to the choice set generation process by using smart card data to calibrate the master choice set to the final set. Bovy (2009) proposes a conceptual model of route choice set generation whereby travellers use an elimination-by-aspects procedure to generate their choice sets. This involves, (i) ordering attributes in terms of their importance, and (ii) eliminating alternatives based on the values of these attributes. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem with the objectives of simultaneously maximizing coverage and efficiency (minimizing false negatives and false positives, respectively) of the final choice set as compared to the observed chosen routes in the smart card data by changing attribute ordering and threshold values for elimination. This methodology is applied for smart card data from the urban public transport network of The Hague, Netherlands where attribute ordering and threshold preferences of travellers are estimated.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-10 13:29,0/0,,Nowy

","We discuss the concept and applicability of macroscopic descriptions of operations for railways systems. The concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram has been recently found empirically and used to understand current traffic state and control actions to keep traffic flow smooth, for local and long distance traffic. The railway mode has the same goals of maximizing speed and flow, though it has many substantial differences with car traffic. Currently no macroscopic evaluation of railway operations are existing, with multiple approaches able to relate the characteristics are based on microscopic approaches, modelling position, speed, timetable plan of each vehicle unit. Macroscopic approaches based on queuing theory are complementary to approaches base don macroscopic fundamental diagrams, as they are able to report the average condition of a system, and not its variation over a set of possible states. Moreover, the states can be latent, and variable, i.e. not known at any given moment. We investigate the theoretical possibility to derive an macroscopic representations of the transport variables speed, density, flow, for railway traffic. Railway traffic has many differences compared to road cars, starting from the driving on absolute braking distance, having blocks which separate trains, and units of a relevant length. Moreover, there are typically fewer vehicles running per unit of space and time, thus making aggregation troublesome. A large set of simulation experiments identifies critical factors in allowing a coherent and meaningful summary of the state of the network, as dependent on many factors related to infrastructure design, operating rules, vehicles dynamics and operation plan. We put the system in relation with what closed expression of the system evolution would determine, for a single vehicle and a set of vehicles running and interacting with each other. The implications for applicability of macroscopic representations in railways or railway-like systems are derived and discussed.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-10 15:09,0/0,,Nowy

","The railroad network consists of performance-capable primary routes and numerous secondary lines, which hold a high importance for regional passenger and freight transportation. To assure the safety of traffic processes at those branch lines, railway signalling technology is needed. Often times the therefor needed infrastructure is either technologically outdated or has too high demands in terms of costs, maintenance and staff. A further use respectively a modernization of this infrastructure threatens the economic viability of those routes given the low traffic volume. This is the reason for research work on innovative possibilities for railway control, safety and signalling. This paper will discuss a holistic decentralized vehicle-mounted safety and dispatching logic approach for train protection based on a digital train register book and the regulation on secondary lines while maintaining the same level of safety as conventional control and safety systems. This approach contains three main components: A decentralized safety concept including a data storage, a digital IP-based communication link as well as a positioning and integrity monitoring regime. This paper includes the presentation of a safety concept based on a digital train register book. We will show and discuss aspects which have to be considered in such an architecture, especially concerning the granting of Movement Authorities (MA), interoperability with the European Train Control System (ETCS) and barrier-free accessibility of railway tracks. Another task of railway control and signalling is the localization of rail bound vehicles. To ensure ETCS interoperability and track selective locating of trains, a high-precision and robust positioning system has to utilized. Since train regulation is a safety-critical application, availability and integrity of the positioning system has to be guaranteed and monitored. This requirement cannot be warranted by GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) alone, especially in demanding environments. Therefor the followed positioning approach is based on a multi-sensor data fusion, including GNSS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Odometer and Digital Maps. Since field test in the railway domain are very expensive and difficult to organize, we validate the above mentioned positioning and integrity monitoring algorithms using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) laboratory setup. This setup replays collected real-world data and enables us to validate the quality of different algorithms and parametrizations in a replicable and comparable manner. With this Record and Playback system we are also able to look into different scenarios. The entire system, including vehicle-mounted safety logic, communication utilities and positioning module will be shown and validated in a laboratory demonstrator at TU Dresden.","Keywords: Railway Safety and Control, Railway Signalling, Secondary railway lines, Multisensor GNSS Positioning, Integrity Monitoring, RAIM",VN,,,2018-10-11 10:17,0/0,,Nowy

","Like for other transport modes, the success of Bike-sharing systems depends on an optimal balance between the supply and the demand. As spatial and temporal fluctuations of bike rentals lead to a sub-optimal distribution of bikes between different urban areas, the main challenge to handle bike-sharing systems in an efficient way is to understand the underling structure of its demand. This paper contributes to the existing research on this topic by introducing a new approach to synthesize mobility data into vectors and to identify mobility patterns. Specifically, we assume that we can break down the demand for bike-sharing services in two components: systematic behaviour (i.e. trips performed on a daily, weekly or seasonal basis) and unique or non- systematic behaviour (i.e. work-place relocation or special events). Under this assumption, we develop a framework to infer systematic behaviour from a historical database of bike-sharing trips and to use this information to predict the demand for each bike-sharing station. The proposed methodology is composed of two main components, named aggregation and clustering and prediction and disaggregation. Aggregation and clustering (AaC): In this phase, we synthesize mobility data into “so-called” vectors of movement. They connect the centre of gravity of trip origins with the centre of gravity of trip destinations weighted by the number of trips. This synthetic representation of mobility allows reducing the set of recorded trips into compact structure convenient for further processing. Such vector formulation allows for comparison with classical similarity measures (e.g. cosine similarity). Prediction and disaggregation (PaD): The AaC phase groups historical observations on bike-sharing trips in clusters of similar day-type. However, for the same day type, different demand values can be observed. This is an expected output, as the demand for bike sharing systems not only fluctuates within the day but also changes with respect to other phenomena, among the other, season and weather conditions. As a consequence, the prediction model identifies the most likely “vector of movement” for a given season and meteorological condition, which are well-known to be the main elements influencing the bike sharing demand, and disaggregates this information in demand values that can be used to forecast the demand for each bike-sharing station. We illustrate the method with a publicly available trip data from New York public bike system. We collect and synthesize trip data from summer 2017 (over 3 million bike trips). Preliminary results show that the clustering identifies two main groups of observations. Cluster (1) contains observations about the working days (Monday to Friday), while Cluster (4) mostly includes weekends. The main contribution of this paper with respect to the state of the state of the art is not only to provide predictions of the demand for bike sharing systems, as different machine learning techniques have already been proposed in the literature. The novelty is within the proposed clustering technique, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem and, differently from other machine learning techniques, does not require to formulate specific assumptions on the model or parameters tuning.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-11 14:52,0/0,,Nowy

","Given the increasing concerns related to health, environmental degradation, and climate change externalities of transportation, motorized vehicles dominated road transport exists as the major cause for pollutants emitted and air pollution related deaths. The road vehicles in which traction is powered with renewable energy through either an electrical or a hybrid motor are therefore available as environmentally friend alternatives in today’s vehicular technology despite their cons including the limited driving ranges, battery recharging times, and relatively higher costs. However, the present case is that the need to a broader contribution of electric vehicles emerges for environmental sustainability when the current share of electric vehicles in the market is considered. The issues related to the use of electric vehicles for people and/or goods transport therefore possess broad research and development problems, which motivated us to investigate a variant of the electric vehicle routing problem with multiple objectives to be utilized in the decision making process on renewing the university shuttle bus fleet that is currently composed of all internal combustion engine vehicles. In the present study, we handle a light electric bus routing problem for the pick-up and drop-off of students within a road network that serves a university campus area with colleges, dormitories, social and recreational areas, and etc. We demonstrate that the multi-objective formulation using the spatial and temporal get-on/off demand of students at each bus stop together with the power consumption characteristics of light electric vehicles, the electricity consumption rates in areas where state universities are located, and an assumption on fast charging station mounting costs. Aiming to minimize the costs of multiple objectives on vehicle operating, recharging, and fast charging station implementation the integer programming model we formulate finds the least cost set of routes and charging station nodes for the vehicles originating from a single depot that serves to all the campus-wide student transport demand by not exceeding the driving range without visiting a charging station. Each of the objectives is computed as a function of the relevant binary decision variable and its parameter, i.e.: the cost of traversing an arc; the cost of recharging at a node; and the cost of mounting a charger at a node, having been constrained by the get-on/off demands of bus stops, capacities of electric vehicles, and the maximum that a vehicle can traverse between recharges. The numerical example performed is set on real road network of a university campus with 113 arcs and 68 nodes. In order to differentiate the effect of the multiple objective formulation on optimal routes, we formulate a capacitated vehicle routing problem for the current shuttle bus fleet composed of internal combustion engine vehicles. We obtain the model based exact solutions via a commercial solver using Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-26500 processors each at 2.00 Ghz, and 32 GB of RAM. Comparative evaluations of the routes and charging nodes generated by the optimal solution with respect to the routes of the shuttle plan currently in use are presented considering criteria on overall costs and exhaust emissions.",,MB,,,2018-10-11 16:16,0/0,,Nowy

","Shared Mobility is currently one of the most innovative urban mobility systems, characterized by a high digital component able to supply customers with a considerable level of flexibility in urban trips. Car sharing is widely recognized by policy makers as a good strategy to combat urban traffic congestion and the occupation of public spaces. Many studies have been carried out to try to define the social, economic and environmental impacts of this service. The goal of this paper is to explore the potential demand among university students for electric car sharing and to implement a Hybrid Choice Model (HCM) to gain greater insight into the role of the pro-environmental attitude on users’ willingness to car sharing. The paper provides a double contribution to research activity on shared mobility: i) the willingness of university students to use electric car sharing; ii) the implementation of an HCM to analyze the role of the latent attitude in order to evaluate the added value of green design of electric car sharing, compared to traditional services, in attracting demand. The study was conducted focusing on the E-go car sharing project, promoted by the University of Roma Tre and Enel Energia S.p.A. E-go is a university electric car sharing system. The analysis has been based on the data collected in a survey among the potential users of the e-go car sharing service. The survey was structured as follows: i) the first section contains questions regarding the socio-economic features of the interviewee; ii) the second section includes psychometric items using the psychometric construct Biospheric Value Orientation for the pro-environmental attitude. The first results show 1) poor familiarity of interviewees with electric cars, 2) pro-environmental attitude is stronger in women and in the Social Sciences departments, 3) students from the scientific departments, Engineering and Economics, are more inclined to use the car sharing service. However, the pro-environmental attitude does not seem significant in explaining the willingness of users to consider e-go car sharing service as an alternative mode of transport. These results could help car sharing operators and policy makers to plan promotional strategies and to develop policies aimed at supporting the expansion of this service.",,MB,,,2018-10-12 09:05,0/0,,Nowy

","Observed trends in modern aviation indicate that the constructors of autonomous on-board electrical networks, both civilian aircrafts of leading manufacturers (Airbus, Boeing), as well as military aircrafts of the leading aviation company (Lockheed Martin) face a major challenge of integrating dispersed energy sources, in particular in the implementation of the concept of partially/fully electric MEA/AEA aircraft (More/All Electric Aircraft). Their increasing role in the field of power electronics means that they will have a significant impact on the operation of electrical and power networks, including on-board networks. In the area of generation/processing, transmission and distribution of energy in the electrical network of the aircraft, the aim is to further optimize the on-board electricity network, efficient distribution and increase the power supply security. The goal of the paper is to develop an intelligent system for managing and distributing direct and alternating voltage by developing a mathematical model of the considered system in the correct functioning of key components of the electricity management system, including generator, starter/generator, auxiliary power unit APU (Auxiliary Power Unit), emergency air turbine RAT (Ram Air Turbine), etc. of an aircraft compatible with the concept of electrified aircraft. Based on the above, this paper mainly focuses on solving problems in improving the efficiency, reliability and maintenance of aircraft electrical systems, as the basic components of the power management system function properly, both by meeting the requirements for redundancy and damage resistance (in particular in terms of the ability to deliver uninterrupted power), backup of main power sources, as well as in the scope of requirements due to their cost, weight, energy quality and electromagnetic compatibility EMC (ElectroMagnetic Compatibility). The above requirements apply mainly to the first component system of the ASE (Autonomous Electrical Power Supply System), i.e. the power supply system EPS (Electric Power System). In turn, the second component system of ASE includes the power electronics system PES (Power Electronics Systems), whose key requirements in field of its leading components, which include multi-pulse rectifiers (6-, 12- and 18-, 24-) impulse, concern the implementation of multi-stage inverters in energy management systems. Because of the need to provide power to even a part of the onboard energy sources, solutions are implemented, based on the use of redundant mains buses together with aircraft power management systems. This method of power supply allows both the coupling of basic power sources to the on-board power buses according to the energy demand, as well as the transfer of users between the individual power buses, using different control strategies for this purpose. On the basis of the analysis, the aircraft's management and distribution system was developed in line with the trend of a more electric aircraft. Developed mathematical model of the system, describing the physical phenomena occurring in the process of transmission and distribution of electric energy on the aircraft network was analyzed, confirming by simulation tests. In the final part of the work, based on the created mathematical model and simulations carried out in the Matlab/Simulink programming environment, final practical conclusions were drawn.",Basic article,VN,,,2018-10-13 21:36,0/0,,Nowy

","The paper attempts to present the cooperation of selected basic components of the on-board autonomous power supply system ASE (Autonomous Electrical Power Supply System) in its subsystem components, i.e. the power supply system EPS (Electric Power System) and the power electronics system PES (Power Electronics Systems). The subject of detailed considerations and simulation tests is the functionality of the pulse generator operation, based on PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pulse width modulation technology in the field of the PES system of the management system and electric energy distribution in accordance with the concept of a more electric MEA/AEA aircraft (More/All Electric Aircraft). In the developed concept of the system three variants of the architecture of the electricity distribution system on board of the modern civilian aircrafts (Airbus, Boeing) as well as military aircraft F-22 Raptor and JSF (Joint Strike Fighter) F-35 of the largest aviation company (Lockheed Martin) were defined. The process of controlling the switching and distribution of electric energy in an aircraft compliant with the MEA concept was based on the PWM signal generator implemented on the program path, intended for independent control of the whole ASE system network (EPS, PES) in accordance with the trend of the electrified aircraft. The solution presented in the article is characterized by exceptionally good efficiency, related to small voltage and current decays in the analyzed electrical circuit of the aircraft energy management and distribution system. The paper discusses the essence of implementation and the principle of operation of the PWM generator and makes a comparative description of the proposed solution with hardware solutions. It should be noted that the AC-DC converter control system, which is part of the ASE aircraft's electric network, is operated using a continuous PWM modulation choke of the frequency of 20 kHz. Physical phenomena occurring during the control process in the scope of the above systems was described using mathematical equations (mathematical model) and the results of simulation tests obtained at this stage were presented. The process of switching the state of work in the on-board electrical network of the aircraft in accordance with the concept of MEA management and distribution of electricity in the field of converting AC current and AC voltage into DC voltage and current is illustrated by current and voltage waveforms. The characteristics of the power waveform in the analyzed electrical circuit of the aircraft's power system were also presented in accordance with the concept of a more electric aircraft. Based on the above, in the final part of the work, the illustrated simulation waveforms of the discussed solution were analyzed, supported by the created mathematical model and practical conclusions were drawn regarding the use of the PWM pulse generator management and distribution system for the aircraft compatible with the MEA/AEA concept.",Additional article,VN,,,2018-10-13 21:41,0/0,,Nowy

","In light of the increasing trend towards vehicle connectivity and automation, there will be areas and situations on the roads where high automation can be granted, and others where it is not allowed or not possible. These are termed ‘Transition Areas’. Without proper traffic management, such areas may lead to vehicles issuing take-over requests (TORs), which in turn can trigger transitions of control (ToCs), or even minimum-risk manoeuvres (MRMs). In this respect, the TransAID Horizon 2020 project develops and demonstrates traffic management procedures and protocols to enable smooth coexistence of automated, connected, and conventional vehicles, with the goal of avoiding ToCs and MRMs, or at least postponing/accommodating them. In first instance, we provide an outline of the state-of-the-art of traffic management, putting the focus first on general approaches, including coordinated network-wide traffic management, using KPIs, layered architectures spanning the range from top-down regulation over self-organisation to full bottom-up regulation, and Traffic Management-as-a-Service. Next, we look at the trend towards more cooperative systems which is well-suited for enhanced traffic management, making the systems smarter by targeting (cooperative/connected) vehicles individually. Moreover, we look at the expected impacts that machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence in general would have on traffic management. In itself, all these solutions are very fine and usable. However, there are no (readily available) integrated traffic management experiments or setups, taking higher degrees of vehicle automation into account. Nor do they allow the interplay between all the various solutions to lead to a better system performance. This is where TransAID makes the difference by creating a traffic management framework. Fleet managers of connected and/or autonomous vehicles (CAVs), as well as road authorities, both operate backend centres to manage their fleets and traffic networks, respectively. To effectively and systematically manage transition areas on a large scale and for multiple AV fleets and multiple road authorities, TransAID positions itself as an intermediary service provider, acting as a trusted (and possibly mandated) third party. It will then represent the single-point-of-contact for road authorities and traffic participants (or indirectly, via their OEMs). Within TransAID we defined five different use cases where disruptions of traffic flow are expected to be most severe as a result of transition between automation levels. In addition, all use cases are elaborated with general descriptions, timelines, road networks, and requirements on the vehicle capabilities, vehicle numbers, and traffic compositions. The use cases themselves are focused on providing path advice around obstacles (blocked lanes), providing speeds and headway/lane advice to accommodate merging strategies at on-ramps, enabling traffic separation at the latter in order to smoothly join (C)AVs and conventional vehicles, managing MRMs by guiding vehicles to safe spots, and scheduled distribution of ToCs/MRMs. For each of these use cases, we explain when, where, and how traffic management measures should be applied. The measures are implemented in the iTETRIS simulation platform (using SUMO as a microscopic representation of traffic flows and NS-3 to achieve realistic communication capabilities and collective sensing). They are calibrated and validated using predefined sets of KPIs/metrics.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-14 15:47,0/0,,Nowy

","The current method of organizing traffic flows in urban networks uses directional right-of-way links to move traffic between urban intersections. Conflict resolution between vehicles is almost exclusively exercised at the intersections, which turns them into bottlenecks of our urban traffic systems. Even an attempt to model a different organization of traffic hits a major barrier, because the traditional simulation models do not offer enough flexibility to model bidirectional traffic on individual links in the network. To address this issue the authors developed a novel, agent-based, microsimulation platform (called FAUSIM) which enables modeling of flexible utilization of urban roads. The outputs from this tool have been validated, successfully, in comparison with a commonly utilized Vissim models. Previous experiments of the same researchers illustrated the ability of FAUSIM to model conventional and unconventional traffic control scenarios. For example, FAUSIM was used to model a CADLARIC scenario where directional driving paths are altered between neighboring lanes to align vehicles for decreased conflict for left and right turns at intersections where a reservation-based algorithm is utilized to process conflicts. In addition to CADLARIC, FAUSIM can be used to model conventional fixed-time (FT) control, intelligent intersection management scenarios, and others. The initial results of the experiments with CADLARIC, executed on a small three-intersection corridor, have shown that such flexible-arterials-utilization concepts significantly outperform conventional driving with the FT control. The benefits of CADLARIC were observed both from safety and efficiency perspective of traffic evaluation. However, it is understandable that more safety-conservative scenarios increase delays and vice versa. This paper takes experiments with CADLARIC to the next level by addressing this tradeoff between safety and efficiency applied in the conflict-resolution process of the CADLARIC and similar intelligent urban control scenarios. The goal of the paper is to investigate and document how various conflict resolution parameters, deployed in the CADLARIC and similar scenarios, impact safety and efficiency performance measures. In the first step the authors will conduct a proper literature review to describe all of the relevant state-of-the art studies. Then they will conduct a various experiments with CADLARIC by varying different conflict resolution parameters. Directly or indirectly, such experiments will consider various penetration rates of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs); or in the other words - a scenarios with human drivers will be considered as well. It is expected that the results of sensitivity analysis will show points/regions of 'profitable tradeoff points' where neither too much efficiency nor safety is sacrificed to obtain a 'good solution'. The result section will be followed by a proper discussion of the meaning of the results and their comparison with findings from the comparative studies. It is also expected that the results will give some indication on how realistic it would be to see CADLARIC scenario implemented in predominantly human-driven traffic, considering the inputs from traffic behavior taken from bypassing maneuvers on the two-lane roads. The paper will be concluded with a summary of findings and directions for future research.",Reviewers/editors can contact the corresponding author to provide a YouTube video of the mentioned CADLARIC scenario (to ascertain validity of the proposed approach).,RK,TAK,Very interesting and novel approach.

","In the present study, we design an H∞ state-feedback controller (H∞SFC) for density-based regulation of freeway traffic flow taking into account the queue lengths obtained by ramp metering and variable speed limit techniques. The disturbances, in terms of breakdowns, due to the merging on-ramp flows are sought to be controlled with a controlled output. The proposed controller is then tested using a microscopic simulation environment in order to figure out the emission effects of the freeway traffic. On purpose, we use the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) equation to design the control algorithm. Considering the need to write flow variable in terms of the density variable we adopt a linear car-following model in order to derive the fundamental relationship of flow vs. density. Error terms are defined as the deviation of densities from the critical density on each segment bounded by succeeding on and/or off-ramps. The queue length for each on-ramp together with the error terms are used to form the state vector. The closed loop system (CLS) is obtained having defined a linear state feedback controller. In order to cope with the disturbances caused by the on-ramp flows under the proposed model’s framework, an H∞SFC is designed for the performance index, J, as an integral function of the time-dependent controlled output, the time-dependent disturbance input, and a non-negative constant. A theorem is stated to make the CLS asymptotically stable and J smaller than 0 for every square integrable non-zero time-dependent disturbance input on the interval [0;1) so that the proposed linear state feedback controller is said to be an H∞SFC. As the test bed, a generic corridor with four on-ramps and an off-ramp over the E-80 freeway in Istanbul is selected and modeled using the PTV AG VISSIM. In order to integrate the above mentioned control mechanism, the algorithm is coded using MATLAB and executed via COM interface. 3 hours long simulations involving both the no control and the H∞SFC cases are conducted partitioning the freeway stretch into equal pieces of 200 meters. The minimum green time, as 5 seconds, and the cycle time, as 15 seconds, are considered for the control purposes. The critical values on the free-flow speed, optimal density, and the maximum density are set to 120 kph, 80 vpkm, and 200 vpkm respectively. In order to model both the link-based and the network-wide exhaust emissions, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and volatile organic compound, together with the fuel consumption the integrated simulation model is run both with and without control. This summarized research provides an overview to the application of the combined variable speed limit and ramp metering algorithm on a real freeway network piece located in Istanbul. Coordinated ramp metering and variable speed limit using H∞SFC gives better results for minimizing the average densities of the main stream over the segments and network-wide traffic emissions in contrast to no control case without having a dramatic increase in the average queue lengths of the corresponding on-ramps.",,VN,,,2018-10-15 16:32,0/0,,Nowy

","As urban populations grow, many public transport systems are experiencing increasing congestion and crowding. In-vehicle crowding has negative effects on traveler satisfaction and well-being. For bus services there is also a negative feedback loop between crowding, delays and arrival time irregularity. Consequently, more vehicles are required to serve the demand, which leads to significant costs for the operator. In recent years, many cities have started to provide real-time bus arrival time information at stops or in mobile applications. Systems providing real-time crowding information (RTCI) are less common in practice. In theory, RTCI provision will allow travelers to make more informed decisions and could nudge them towards vehicles and lines with lower crowding. Providing timely crowding information generally requires that vehicle passenger loads at target stops be predicted some time in advance. In simulation settings, various prediction schemes have been proposed and evaluated. It has been demonstrated that predictive RTCI may equalize crowding among vehicle trips and reduce passengers’ experienced travel time. As far as we are aware, however, no studies have tackled the bus crowding prediction problem in an empirical context. This paper formulates the bus crowding prediction problem based on real-time AVL and automated passenger count (APC) data and evaluates the performance of several prediction methods (step-wise regression, lasso, and boosted tree ensembles). Two variants are considered: (1) vehicle-centered prediction focusing on a specific vehicle run, and (2) stop-centered prediction focusing on a specific bus stop. The former is useful for operators and for RTCI provision to in-vehicle and transferring passengers, while the latter is useful for RTCI provision to passengers waiting at stops or in mobile applications. The problem is studied for the busiest high-frequency bus line in Stockholm, Sweden. Prediction accuracy is evaluated with respect to absolute passenger loads as well as predefined discrete crowding levels. Load prediction accuracy is compared for three levels of data availability: (1) historical APC data only, (2) historical APC data and real-time AVL data, and (3) historical APC data and real-time AVL and APC data. Historical APC data capture systematic trends in passenger loads depending on the target station, time of day, weekday, and month of the year. Real-time AVL data capture the current headway to the preceding bus, which is positively correlated to the passenger load. Finally, real-time APC data capture the passenger load and number of boarding and alighting passengers at the most recent stops. Results show that historical load patterns are useful for real-time prediction. Compared to using only historical load data, real-time AVL data improves prediction accuracy up to 15-20 minutes before the bus departs from the target station. Real-time APC data further improves prediction accuracy, particularly up to 5-10 minutes before departure and towards the end of the line. The implemented prediction methods all perform similarly. The results imply that prediction with real-time APC data give travelers as well as operators enough time to take actions in response to the crowding conditions that will be encountered.",,MB,,,2018-10-16 10:51,0/0,,Nowy

","The rising scope of urban traffic and traffic jams has a name: “Carmageddon” [1]. The progressing traffic collapse burdens the economy and the traveler. From the monetary perspective, Europe currently suffers from immense costs caused by traffic jams [1]. From the temporal perspective, European travelers lose hundreds of hours during traffic jams each year [2]. In order to reduce these costs, we need innovative multi-modal pre-trip information systems (IS) [3]. Without multi-modal pre-trip IS, planning individual mobility and selecting mobility options is still a pain point for many travelers [4]. For example, users have to analyze different sources of information and combine many decision-relevant aspects [5]. Hence, many travelers stick to habitual mobility behavior without weighing up different alternatives [6]. Multi-modal solutions will, however, facilitate individual mobility planning by presenting alternatives proactively and thus reducing the cognitive load of modal and temporal choices. Since the integration of multi-modal mobility services in the everyday life of the end-user is still in its infancy stages [3], [5], this paper focuses on the customer-centered development of multi-modal pre-trip IS. We focus on an ideal customer journey for the situation in which travelers inform themselves about their mobility options at home. Based on empirical insights, we implemented mobility-centered features into a smart mirror prototype. We decided to implement our features into a smart mirror where users can derive information in passing, eliminating the need to start an applications and actively search for information. We mainly integrated four mobility-centered features, namely (1) a personal agenda, (2) a multi-modal routing service (i.e., own car, car sharing, public transport), (3) vehicle-centered information (e.g., tank fill), and (4) charging recommendations for electric vehicles. Besides mobility-centered information, we also integrated non mobility-centered features into the prototype. Past research has shown that the travelers’ desire to experience fun or pleasure while using intelligent traveler information systems (i.e., hedonic motivation) significantly predicts their intention to use the service [7]. Therefore, we combined the primarily pragmatic mobility-centered features with entertaining hedonic features which are meant to motivate the user to use multi-modal mobility planning. Here, we integrated (1) a digital picture and memo board for sharing pictures and messages and (2) a food and lifestyle feature with recommendations for concerts and restaurants. Finally, we evaluated the prototype in a quantitative user study with n = 174 participants. After an introduction and subsequent testing of the prototype in a show room of our industrial partner, the users answered several questions concerning the prototype’s pragmatic and hedonic qualities as well as their experienced need fulfillment and intention to use the prototype. The results of our regression analysis shows that both pragmatic and hedonic qualities and the users’ experienced need fulfillment significantly predict the users’ intention to use the prototype. In conclusion, our implementation and evaluation contributes to the further development of multi-modal pre-trip IS. Our results contribute to our understanding of how to motivate travelers to use multi-modal mobility services and how we can reduce the travelers’ cognitive load during the mobility-centered decision-making process.","Keywords Advanced traveler information systems, multi-modal mobility, pre-trip information systems, user needs.

","Public transport networks are a key factor for development of urban and peri-urban mobility. Their design is a main contributor to their possible success. Determining line planning, timetabling and vehicle scheduling is a complex set of problems, which are interconnected in many ways. The development is typically tackled by hand, incorporating multiple objectives, in a time-consuming way. All decisions require multi-objective optimisation. To simplify matters, these planning steps are usually carried out sequentially. However, research has shown that integrated approaches lead to superior solutions. On the other hand, integrated approaches increase computational complexity. We report on a toolbox, which is able to seamlessly integrate the different steps, based on open data formats and interfaces. A general framework formalises all relevant information and ensures the exchange and interoperability between any solution of the three separated problems (line planning, timetabling, vehicle scheduling). Then, we formulate the three problems to iterate between the planning steps within an approach inspired by the eigenmodel structure by (Schoebel, 2017, An eigenmodel for iterative line planning, timetabling and vehicle scheduling in public transportation, Transportation Research C). We refine existing approaches to jointly minimise costs and travel time. Thanks to the extensions and framework we may shrink the size of the problems without loss of optimality. The iterative solution approach can significantly reduce complexity, while the extended approaches of line planning, timetabling and vehicle scheduling allow for the consideration of all relevant limitations. As a testcase, we report a study in the region of Bern, Switzerland. The solution computed for a network of regional buses significantly decreases the required effort of the planners. The added value lies in the better quality of the solution and the shorter response time, enough to support interactive optimization.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-17 17:56,0/0,,Nowy

","Timing issue is very critical for emergency service. Due to the increasing traffic it has become more and more challenging for emergency vehicles to reach their destinations within a given service period in cities, especially during rush hours. Therefore, there is a need to model routing strategies to support emergency vehicles. Microscopic traffic simulation can therefore be an adequate decision-support tool for route strategies analysis. The GPS positions of 24 emergency vehicles in Brunswick have been tracked over a time period of 2 years. In this paper, the route choice behavior of emergency vehicles is analyzed with the collected trajectory data in Brunswick, Germany. In addition, microscopic traffic simulation is also used to understand the deviation between simulated and real route choices. For this purpose an emergency vehicle model was implemented in the traffic simulation SUMO. The emergency vehicle model allows vehicle in the simulation to violate red traffic lights and force other traffic participants to give way etc. Emergency vehicle drivers have time pressure when they are on duty. Furthermore, the likelihood for emergency vehicle drivers being involved in a traffic accident is significant higher compare to normal vehicles. Therefore, their concern on route choice may be different from that of other normal road users. Besides travel time the other essential route choice factors are also investigated and derived for developing the respective route choice model so that the costs of the simulated routes of emergency vehicles are close to those in the reality. It is expected that the developed model can be transferable and applied in other cities.",,RK,TAK,"Very interesting problem, would be pleased to see more on methodology in the full paper.",2018-10-18 09:48,0/0,,Nowy

","Reducing pollutant emissions and promoting sustainable mobility solutions, including Public Transport, are increasingly becoming key objectives for policymakers worldwide. To jointly achieve these goals, careful consideration should be put on the operational cost and management of PT services, in order to promote the adoption of green mobility solutions and advanced management techniques by operators. Adopting fully electric vehicles isn’t however straightforward from the tactical/operational perspective: e-buses exhibit shorter driving ranges compared to hybrid and conventional combustion alternatives, requiring within-day recharging operations, which poses extra constraints to the state-of-the-art problem of transit scheduling. Solutions to this problem must be developed with care, as a trade-off exists between exploiting the available full-electric fleet to serve scheduled trips at a reduced cost (compared to either internal combustion or hybrid buses), and the cost of recharging. Indeed, while recent technological advancements have substantially reduced the time required to fully recharge an e-bus battery, this comes at a considerable cost in terms of energy prices. To address these issues, in this work we develop a dynamic fleet management approach for next generation Public Transportation systems, considering the instance of mixed electric / hybrid fleet. Our objective is that of investigating to what extent electrification, coupled with optimal fleet management, can yield operational cost savings for PT operators, explicitly considering real-time disturbances, including delays, service disruptions etc. To this end we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program formulation to address the problem of optimal scheduling of a mixed fleet of electric and hybrid / non-electric buses and we consider the problem of optimally determining the sequence of buses departing from a multi-line bus terminal, considering both service constraints (schedule adherence) and energy constraints (electric bus charging status, bus recharging scheduling in capacitated facilities). By basing ourselves upon the real-life scenario of Luxembourg City, we showcase both how relevant appropriate modelling is when computing an offline daily plan for the dispatching of a mixed plug-in hybrid and electric fleet, and, most importantly, how robust the proposed model is when employed in real-time fleet management applications. In order to apply the model to complex real-life problems, we also defined a time-based decomposition framework. The memory size of the MILP problem significantly grows with the number of trips, number of time intervals and number of buses: decomposing the main problem in several smaller and interconnected time lapses allows us to scale to very large problems with a small loss of optimality, while keeping computational performance very reasonable. The proposed model’s online performances are evaluated in a Model Predictive Control framework, considering stochastic trip completion times as arising from a mesoscopic bus simulator. Following the Rolling Horizon approach, at each time step we employ the proposed MILP model to anticipate the bus system’s behavior and compute the optimal scheduling decisions related to the given timestep’s timetabled trips. Test results show that the proposed model is suitable for dynamic fleet management based upon model predictive control, retaining a very solid level of performance even when facing considerable disturbances and delays.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-18 15:28,0/0,,Nowy

","Let's propose a game for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) played as they traverse the road network. The game resembles classic Wardop game where routes may be adjusted to minimize user costs. Clasically this game is thought to be played by humans who every day adjust their route choices to minimize travel costs. However CAVs' capabilities to communiacte allow to formulate a different and interesting game. Instead of adjusting the route choice after arriving at destination they may adjust it en-route. Instead of learning network travel costs at the destination they may update it enroute.Every turn of the game players broadcast information on their path to vehicles in a given communiaction range, similarly their receive this information from players within range. They can utilize this information and update their path in the next turn. This way the choices can be reconsidered every turn based on information which is actual yet limited (with a communication range). Let's consider possible strategies each CAV may have to optimize travel costs. Starting from naive assumption than other CAVs do not adjust their choices, throug Stackelberg equiblirium, up to specific version of User Equilibrium.

","Efficient route planning over a strongly connected directed graph is a very important topic in modern transportation and logistics management. Finding the best route in a network is a standard problem in deterministic networks but becomes extremely difficult in networks with random edge lengths, especially when the distribution is non-independent and non-stationary. Among the many possible approaches from the vast literature on transportation and routing, one of the closest to our setting is the recent ground breaking line of work about the links between the Schroedinger bridge and optimal transport and their relation to robust transport. The route planning problem for multiple vehicles can be recast into a measure approximation problem and a ""Hilbert metric""-based contraction mapping is presented that allows fast iterative computation of the optimal solution. In the present paper, we show that, the problem can be addressed by finding a stochastic route closest to a given non-homogeneous Markov dynamical process in the relative entropy metric. Our main contributions are - a model for the baseline Markov process to be approximated that accounts for the dynamical evolution of the road network, - a new algorithm for joint optimal routing plan and confidence interval computation.",,VN,,,2018-10-20 15:00,0/0,,Nowy

","Attention has been given on real-time travel time estimation in road networks for decades. However, there is lack of real-time traffic information for pedestrian networks in practice. For densely populated urban areas in metropolitan cities like Hong Kong, it would be very useful to provide pedestrians with the latest traffic information on the walking environment so as to make their travel efficiently. On the other hand, the real-time pedestrian traffic information system can also be used to monitor the movement of crowds and the performance of walking facilities. Most of the existing monitoring systems for pedestrians could only count the number of people passing through at given and fixed locations. Information like real-time crowd travel time in walking facilities is often missing due to the difficulties of re-identifying the same pedestrian from different detectors. In recent years, Wi-Fi signal detection offers an opportunity to match Median Access Control (MAC) address from different scanners for travel time estimation. The basic idea is that electronic mobile devices (e.g. cell phones, tablets and notebooks etc.) with Wi-Fi function all have a unique MAC address for identification purpose, as they will voluntarily send their information to nearby access points for operation. Wi-Fi scanner is a device capable of receiving frames from these mobile devices. When pedestrians carrying Wi-Fi enabled devices passing through the detection region of a Wi-Fi scanner, their appearances will be recorded. By matching MAC addresses’ records and their timestamps detected by different scanners at various locations, we are able to keep track the trajectories of these mobile devices’ holders together with their travel times. This technology has been applied to monitor crowd movement at massive events, airports, train stations, etc. However, the application for estimating real-time crowd travel times on pedestrian facilities has not yet been fully studied nor evaluated with ground truth in reality. In the literature, there are several solution algorithms developed for real-time estimation of vehicular travel times but hardly any for estimating the walking times. In this paper, we have evaluated and extended these existing solution algorithms for real-time walking time estimation on pedestrian facilities by using data from Wi-Fi scanners installed in the campus of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Firstly, the existing solution algorithms available in the literature are reviewed and then used to filter and aggregate data collected from different scanners installed in the study area. It follows with that these existing solution algorithms are used to estimate the real-time average walking times by time interval with the data collected in this case study. Using the ground truth provided by video observations at these scanner locations, the performances of these algorithms are evaluated together with discussions on their advantages and disadvantages for estimating the walking times. Based on these evaluation results, some modifications are proposed to the median filtering algorithm for enhancing the walking time estimation. It is shown that the modified algorithm is outperformed among the others in terms of the estimation accuracy with simpler computation process and less empirical parameters required.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-23 04:06,0/0,,Nowy

","The maximum level of performance reachable by traffic control policies is directly affected by the locations and the types of controllers employed in the network. We therefore investigate methods to identify locations and types of controllers that guarantee that the highest possible level of performance can be reached, fully exploiting the available network capacity and minimize the overall installation costs. This condition is known as full controllability. In this work, based on an existing methodological contribution that allows to determine the optimal number and locations of pricing controllers required to reach the maximal level of controllability in transportation networks, we investigate instances and conditions in which the same results can be achieved through Traffic Light controllers, which represent a more realistic and widespread technology. Furthermore, traffic lights are more acceptable than pricing controllers from a public perspective, since their costs is not directly perceived by individual road users: instead of facing a monetary cost, they incur in delays, to which they are less susceptible. Due to the different impact of traffic lights and pricing controllers on the network, however, optimal locations for one set might differ from the optimal locations for the other, and consequently replacing pricing controllers by traffic lights is not a straightforward task. Moreover, an enumeration of every possible combination of traffic light position will result in combinatorial explosion. In order to avoid this problematic, in this work we study simple, atomic subnetwork structures, widely occurring in real-life network, and assess whether it is possible to maintain the maximum level of controllability while replacing pricing controllers with traffic light controllers. This allows us to expose the difficulties of placing traffic lights and identify their impact on the rest of the transportation network. We empirically demonstrate that traffic lights can locally replace pricing controllers and keep the same level of controllability, in the small case network, however on larger network they can have a different effect on the global level of controllability, depending on the full network shape. This first empirical step acts as the basis to study larger and more realistic transportation networks, therefore helping to develop a general methodology to substitute pricing controllers with traffic lights. A prospective work will be to develop methodologies capable of completing an already existing set of controllers for a network exhibiting partial controllability, by suggesting the minimal required addition in terms of controllers, either traffic lights or pricing controllers, in order to reach full controllability.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-24 09:48,0/0,,Nowy

","Harmful gases exhausted from road transport vehicles contain pollutants including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The greenhouse effect caused by the harmful gases has been the main motivation for the stakeholders of both the transport service and the vehicular industry on seeking environmentally friend transportation options. In the purpose of introducing vehicles fueled with alternative energy resources hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) are designed as alternatives to fossil fueled vehicles in transportation. EVs using electric motor to produce the necessary energy can further be classified into two: battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (P-HEVs). HEVs can be considered as the products of the transition from traditional vehicles to EVs with two different power suppliers, i.e., the internal combustion engine and the electric motor. The technical features of EVs including mainly the charging times and driving ranges have become keys to users’ consuming preferences in addition to the prices in the market. Since many different brands’ EVs exist with different characteristics nowadays, it is a challenging task for users/purchasers with environmental concerns to choose the most suitable vehicle for their intended use. In the present study, with the ultimate motivation of aiding the decision-making process for renewing the shuttle bus fleet -that is currently composed of all internal combustion engine vehicles- serving to a university campus, we concentrate on the problem of selecting the most suitable vehicle for a medium-scale settlement’s road network. Given the characteristics on passenger flow, road geometry, and shuttle operation in addition to the technical features of vehicles considered we seek the solution to the problem integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. In the decision-making process, both the AHP and the TOPSIS method allows to make the best choice among alternatives. Using the AHP method, the best alternative is determined according to the overall priorities (weights) of alternatives. When deciding with the TOPSIS method, it is expected that a chosen alternative is close to the positive ideal solution. In our study, while we utilize the AHP method to determine the weights of the selected main and the sub criteria in terms of both qualitative and quantitative data, including economic, technical, and environmental measures as the main criteria and purchasing price, energy consumption, taxing, capacity, motor power, range, climbing ability, turning circle, vehicle weight, maximum speed, vehicle life, CO emission, NOx emission, HC emission, and the particulate emission measures as the sub-criteria, and the TOPSIS method to rank the selected alternatives from a total of six consisting of internal combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles based on the calculated weights in the previous step. Having comparatively evaluated different types of vehicles including internal combustion engine, hybrid, and electric vehicles within a multi-criteria process summarized above we determine the appropriate vehicles to our interest and propose them to be input to vehicle routing based scenario analysis in a separate study.",,MB,,,2018-10-25 10:41,0/0,,Nowy

","Sustainability in transportation is a fundamental element to be considered in the urban planning process, since transport has direct effects on the environmental footprint of a city and on the well-being of its citizens. To achieve a sustainable mobility environment, an efficient public transport framework, in which different means and companies coexist, is essential. Not only is spatial intermodality required, but also a fare integration system needs to be in place with an adequate clearing agreement among the service providers, allowing them to share ticket revenues. Otherwise a barrier to the adoption of public transport would exist, since users may be overwhelmed by the need for different tickets, each associated with its own purchase mode. To combine the needs of users and providers, in this work we present a method to simplify user experience, while at the same time giving companies the means to identify how much they are owed. This is achieved through a flexible ticket validation system, consisting of a multi-options method which uses three different technologies (QR codes, GPS and Bluetooth). As such, the main contributions of this work are: greater flexibility thanks to an innovative validation system using multiple technologies; the novelty of applying a gamification layer to a mobile ticketing solution; the identification of a reliable method for obtaining data useful for clearing purposes. The user is provided with a mobile app through which tickets are bought and used to access transport services. To validate the tickets, this app behaves differently, depending on the technology installed on the vehicles: if Bluetooth beacons are installed on board, the user experiences a totally automated, hands-free process, since both check-in and check-out operations are managed by the app automatically; otherwise, if no beacons are installed, the check-in is done manually, through a QR code placed in the bus, acquired with the device camera, while the check-out is still automated, but through the mobile device GPS signal. This way, a database essential for any clearing system is generated, in which reliable information regarding service use by passengers is stored. The adoption of multiple technologies will: benefit the users, since they will be able to complete a trip on multiple vehicles without worrying about the compatibility of their tickets; leave several options to the companies, since the presence of multiple technologies does not force them to adopt one single solution. In addition to these technological aspects, a gamification feature will be added to the software in order to boost passenger participation. Although gamification is already used in some transport related apps, its use in the context of smart ticketing is proposed to promote check-out operations. The first expected result is an increase in public transport attractiveness for the users, by both simplifying the validation process and improving its efficiency and quality. The other is the collection of key validation related information, which will be exploited mainly for clearing purposes and possibly even in real time to optimize fleet management.",,MB,,,2018-10-26 17:47,0/0,,Nowy

","To limit global warming and strive for more liveable and sustainable cities, innovative zero-emission (ZE) buses are on the rise all around the world. Different alternative vehicle propulsion methods have been introduced during the last decades. However, for now, only trolley, battery and fuel-cell electric vehicles can be classified as (on the pipe) ZE-busses. This research focuses on battery electric buses, since they are most cost-efficient and – therefore - the most promising option for the (near) future. An important limitation of battery electric busses is however the limited range of operations due to capacity restrictions of batteries. Batteries should be (re)charged before, during and/or after the daily operations. Different charging methods, including different charging power systems are available to charge battery electric vehicles. As far as known to the authors, scientific literature focusing on the operations and charging scheduling of electric busses is scarce. In this study, a comparison of different applied charging methods for electric buses is obtained. A ZE-bus station simulation method is developed to assess charging methods and charging regulations with regards to their impacts on a variety of costs and level of service indicators. This simulation-based method is multi applicable, since it is particularly based on general automated vehicle location (AVL) data. To demonstrate our model, a case study at Schiphol (Amsterdam Airport) is performed. This research concludes that the shift to ZE-bus transit is involved with higher costs and passenger disturbances. Investment costs involved with the transition to ZE-busses increase substantially: Most electric vehicles are around 60 to 80 percent more expensive than conventional diesel engine vehicles and additional charging infrastructure investments are required. Benefits of electric operations, including vehicle propulsion cost savings up to 70 percent, are not able to compensate these high investments. The charging method choice and decisions concerning charging method implementation, contain trade-offs between level of service and (vehicle and charging infrastructure) investment costs. (Slow) depot charging offers opportunities for operations on short distance lines. The depot should be located in proximity to a bus station. Moreover, additional vehicles are required in order to replace a vehicle which should be recharged. In this respect, conventional timetables could be complied and the level of service remains unchanged. To prevent fleet overcapacity, vehicles should be recharged fast (with high charging power) along the line. Slight charging related delays of departing vehicles could occur, especially when the number of charging systems is not sufficient, and/or the charging times are relatively long. Bus stations and terminals are suitable as fast charging locations, since charging time could be combined with buffer time there. Purchasing enough charging infrastructure systems, providing matching charging power and considering charging times in timetable planning are necessary measures to keep operations and level of service on a high level. Finally, dynamic/in-motion charging offers opportunities to prevent charging related delays completely due to combined charging and operation time. This charging method is still in its infancy stage yet, so focus is more on (innovative) static charging methods now.",,MB,,,2018-10-27 16:47,0/0,,Nowy

","The objective of the project INZNAK carried out in a consortium of Gdansk University of Technology, AGH University of Science and Technology and 2 commercial firms is to develop a conceptual design and to make research tests of a new kind of intelligent road signs which will enable the prevention of the most common collisions on highways, resulting from the rapid stacking of vehicles resulting most often from accidental heavy braking. A range of products will be developed, including intelligent road signs: standing, hanging and mobile ones, displaying dynamically updated driving speed limit, determined automatically, through an embedded electronic module, enabling multimodal measurement of traffic conditions. Solving a number of research and construction problems, such as: effective and independent of weather conditions traffic monitoring based on simultaneous analysis of several types of data representation, a development of a method of calculating gradients and histograms of vehicle speed for various types of road situations or traffic topologies. Moreover, creating a platform for self-organizing reliable wireless connections among road signs equipped with innovative displays and power supplies and carrying out prototype tests are carried out. As a result, products for increasing road safety for which there is a market demand around the world will be prepared for the future implementation. The context of the project in this respect coincides with EU directives, e.g. the ""European Union White Paper on Transport"" indicating that ""by 2050, almost zero deaths in road transport are assumed"". In addition, the market for completely new V2X applications and solutions will be created. Without intelligent infrastructure, such as proposed in the INZNAK project, it will not be more difficult to fully implement commercial autonomous vehicle technologies. Thanks to INZNAK solutions, the vehicles will be able to communicate faster and more efficiently, as well as with the infrastructure. The bimodal nature of communicating the recommended speed (visual and in the form of messages sent electronically to vehicles) will be the first solution of this type on a global scale, which does not discriminate against users of hitherto manufactured vehicles that are not yet equipped with modern data exchange systems with ICT infrastructure. The solution being developed fits into, in an original way, in the rapidly growing trend of development of communication of cars with the road infrastructure, enabling an access to digital road infrastructure for all drivers. Commercialization of the project results is planned through their application in a business of industrial consortium partners and though the sale of license rights to the intellectual property. The planned implementation may lead to the development of products that increase road safety for which there exists worldwide market demand.",,MB,,,2018-10-27 19:49,0/0,,Nowy

","Intelligent road signs in the basic configuration, namely a stand-alone, autonomous sign, will work in the off-grid island power supply system. Currently available (implemented) technologies of power sources for low-power island systems are: • Photovoltaic batteries • Wind generators • Large capacity batteries The purpose of the test is to check the possibility of obtaining power autonomy for an intelligent road sign. Both photovoltaic batteries and wind generators are characterized by a high variability of energy production depending on unpredictable environmental conditions. During favorable conditions - high insolation, strong wind - these sources must be able to supply energy far exceeding the instantaneous demand, so that the excess energy can be stored in the battery. Variables will also include energy demand. The luminance of the sign and thus the energy consumed will depend on the ambient conditions of the brightness level. Solar panels can be equipped with a positioning system that performs the function of keeping up with the sun, which increases their efficiency. It was decided to equip the stand with this function, so that the efficiency gains could be estimated experimentally. The developed test stand for testing power systems for intelligent road signs consist of: • Wind turbine • Solar panel • Positioning system • Artificial load • Measuring transducers • Recorder To enable simulation of load variability, the use of regulated power receiver has been foreseen.

","Vehicle detection is a crucial task in traffic monitoring systems. In this work we focus on several types of electronic sensors, operating on different physical principles in order to compare their effectiveness in real road conditions. The first implemented and studied kind of traffic detector is the surveillance system based on image data obtained from a small stationary CCTV camera built-in the intelligent road sign. RGB video data were analyzed and also thermal cameras being more independent to lighting conditions were employed. A miniature stationary camera provides one of components of the intelligent road sign developed in the project. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based detectors need big data input, therefore the weakly-supervised learning paradigm is used for the training of a CNN based detector employing labels obtained automatically through an application of video background subtraction algorithms. A method is also presented and studied experimentally for counting vehicles and for determining their movement direction by means of the acoustic vector sensor application. The assumptions of the method employing spatial distribution of sound intensity determined with the help of an integrated 3D intensity probe are discussed. The developed intensity probe was used for the experiments. The mode of operation of the algorithm is presented in conjunction with noise characteristics produced by moving vehicles. Moreover, accelerometers were applied to divide passing car vibrations related to their weight. Doppler sensors are commonly used for movement detection and speed measurement. Low cost motion sensors may be used to construct a device for speed monitoring, However, electromagnetic interferences and imperfections in sensor construction result in degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio. In the paper we outline an algorithm for the reduction of distortions and noise in the signal received from a dual-channel type of Doppler sensor and show results of testing this approach to determining vehicle speed. Constructing cars on the basis of MAC address monitoring becomes popular. Two approaches to solving of this problem can be distinguished, namely: Basic: assuming the use of available hardware (Bluetooth adapter) and execution of application using the HCI interface or Advanced: creation of own hardware - radio module plus software of the ""Baseband controller"" and ""Firmware Link Manager"" layers. Based on this package, one can make a monitoring application and optimize its time resolution. Following the advanced approach we constructed a practical car counter and organized field tests employing it. The remaining modality, gaining an attention is application of LiDAR technology, that is why our Intelligent road sign experimental prototype was equipped in two types of this sensor. In this case, estimation of the traffic exploits optical opacity of cars and laser beam reflections as the physical principle of working. Finally, pneumatic cables for counting vehicles were used as a source of ground truth data. It were needed for interpreting and for comparing data obtained from various types of installed traffic intensity detectors. Consequently, we are able to present in this paper a comparative study on the effectiveness of traffic sensors operating on the basis of different principles of work.",,MB,,,2018-10-28 12:55,0/0,,Nowy

","Traditional Public Transport (PT) services are often not sufficiently flexible to satisfy people’s mobility requirements, especially in rural areas. These areas are typically characterized by weak transport demand and it is not economically convenient for public transport agencies to provide scheduled or frequent services. Consequently, in these areas people are not encouraged to use PT, but they either prefer or are forced to travel by private car. In a transport planning context where i) mobility is considered a right and ii) the main objective is to discourage private car use, one possible approach consists in a trade-off between the needs of the population and those of the companies supply the service. This balance could be achieved through an innovative on-demand service, which involves Demand-Responsive Transit (DRT) that provides flexible and shareable travel options. Nowadays, there are many tools that support the planning and provision of multimodal journeys, but these focus mostly on integration between similar means of transport. Although, as far as the authors are aware, in rare cases carpooling and minibus rental with driver are included, search and reservation is still managed via call centres which is too expensive for areas with weak demand. Technology can help here, especially to meet the needs of travellers to plan real-time multimodal trips that are contextualized to their preferences and permit automatic booking. The availability and usability of a new travel planning system, that supports the user for planning trips via smartphone, is important for persuading people to choose environmentally-friendly travel modes. The objective of this paper is to study and implement an innovative DRT system able to satisfy the mobility needs of people living in weak demand areas and to test it in a well-identified area in Sardinia (Italy). The contribution of this work focuses on three different aspects: 1) flexibility of the service, 2) promotion of multimodal and shared mobility, 3) hierarchization of the transport modes suggested in order of environmental sustainability. The system consists of a server interfaced with users' smartphones (via a new mobile app) and the platforms of public and private transport companies. Through the mobile app, the user indicates the origin, destination and time of the trip and the app shows all the available travel alternatives. This request is managed automatically by the system, which optimizes the routes of the on-demand services, in order to both reduce the number of vehicles needed and ensure a good level of service quality. The following transport services are considered: traditional PT, minibus rental with driver, carpooling and taxi,. A tool supports the service providers in managing the requests and organizing their fleet. New technologies are used to reduce the ratio between the number of passengers and the number of vehicles, and consequently road traffic. The main expected result is an improvement in the shared mobility supply with the proposed DRT service, which aims to bring people closer to public transport stops. Enhancing accessibility reduces environmental impact and improves the relationship between public transport and population.",,MB,,,2018-10-28 16:43,0/0,,Nowy

","On important freight corridors, a large share of traffic consists of trucks. Our hypothesis is that these trucks do not always take the fastest route which causes inefficiencies in the traffic system. Therefore, route choice of truck drivers is of interest to transport planners and traffic management authorities. Compared to passenger cars, little attention has been devoted to understand route choices of the truck drivers. Previous studies have either employed stated preference surveys or utilized the Global Positioning System traces (i.e., revealed preference) to understand the route choice of truck drivers. Moreover, the truck driver's response to incidents is only studied within stated preference settings. The main aim of this paper is to model on-trip route choices of the truck drivers in response to the real-time traffic conditions by utilizing Bluetooth data in combination with loop detector data and variable message sign data. Bluetooth data are used to derive route choices of trucks. Since Bluetooth data does not provide information about the mode type, the trucks are inferred from the data by utilizing the Gaussian mixture model based clustering technique. Loop detector data are utilized to derive the travel times of alternative routes and variable message signs data are used for lane closure information. The on-trip route choice model is based on random utility theory where the utility of a route is specified as a linear function of travel distance, instantaneous travel time, travel time unreliability for the route in the past 10 days and lane closures along the route. A skew based indicator is selected to quantify the unreliability of a route. A case study around the ring of Rotterdam in the Netherlands has been carried out by studying the route choices of truck drivers between the port of Rotterdam and the hinterland. The route choices of truck drivers are modelled using the multinomial logit model for 1671 trucks over a period of four weeks from October 2017 to November 2017. The predictive performance of the model is tested by conducting the out of sample validation. The model results indicate that the parameters are of expected signs and truck drivers significantly value travel distance, instantaneous travel time and lane closure information while making their on-trip route choice. About 40% of the trucks do not take the fastest route which implies that measures focussing on the route choice of trucks have potential to reduce their travel times.","The work described in the abstract is a part of the project ""ToGRIP-Grip on Freight Trips"" supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.",VN,,,2018-10-28 18:24,0/0,,Nowy

","With an ever rising number of flights in the world, an efficient airport passenger management is essential, as it can have a great impact on both customer satisfaction and airport financial performance. Understanding and modelling pedestrian behavior is crucial for a good airport passenger management. This paper is part of a wider project, whose aim is to develop a decision support system for providing information and suggestions to airport users with a smartphone application. This system will be able to improve passengers’ experience, by reducing time spent queueing and waiting, and to raise airport revenues, by increasing the time passengers spend in discretionary activities. This paper focuses specifically on the activity choices made by passengers inside the airport terminal, and a new approach to predict passengers’ behavior using neural networks, is proposed and tested. The activity choices made by passengers are defined according to activity type and time unit, i.e., passengers choose a certain activity type at a certain time unit. Six activity types are defined: mandatory, eating, shopping, waiting, not-at-the-airport, other. Time horizon is defined for all passengers as a span of time before the scheduled flight departs. The time horizon is discretized into several time units. Three systems of neural networks are proposed: 1. Feed-forward architecture (FNN); 2. Recurrent architecture (RNN); 3. Real-time recurrent architecture (RT-RNN). In the first system the only inputs are the general information on the passenger. For each time unit, a FNN predicts the chosen activity type, therefore in this system there are as many networks as the number of time units, and these networks are independent from each other. In the second system, dependency between time units is taken into account: the activity choice at a given time unit depends not only on the passenger characteristics, but also on the activity choices made in the previous time units. The third system exploits the real-time tracking of passengers to improve the prediction precision of the RNN, including as additional inputs the activity choices observed in real-time. The networks were trained with the use of WiFi passengers’ traces collected at Bologna Airport for 2 months. It was possible to reconstruct the activity sequence inside the terminal for each tracked passenger; moreover, it was possible to associate some passengers to a specific flight. WiFi data were anonymous, this means that socio-demographic characteristics of passengers were not available. Passengers characteristics used as inputs in the neural networks were: flight destination, flight carrier, passenger arrival time (minutes before scheduled departure), scheduled time-of-the-day for the departure. The neural networks performance was evaluated according to the number of misclassified activities in the sequences. RNN and, even more, RT-RNN appear to be promising for short-term predictions, whereas for long-term predictions the FNN approach remains more effective. Neural networks performance could be improved, in the future, with the use of WiFi traces containing socio-demographic information. Moreover, other neural network architectures will be tested, for example long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.",,VN,,,2018-10-29 10:50,0/0,,Nowy

","Selection of appropriate means to achieve balance between efficiency and robustness highly depends on characteristics of the specific region of application. A region in the Netherlands faces a wide range of difficulties in bus transit operations such as sparse network, scattered population, high difference in demand between peak and off-peak hours and significant influence of passengers’ structure. Furthermore, the region faces nearly weekly changes of timetables imposing enormous workload onto the schedulers. Efficiency of the operations is maximized, however at the expense of robustness, as tight vehicle schedules cannot capture all delays which then propagate through the network onto other lines. Significant changes of the timetables were not an option, so the operator reached out to explore innovative solutions focusing on vehicle scheduling. Vehicle and crew schedules are currently applied to the whole region allowing vehicles and drivers to be assigned to combinations of all lines. Our approach suggests partitioning of the lines into a defined number of subgroups. Vehicle scheduling, and possibly crew scheduling, is done for each group separately. This would isolate delays within the group, prevent propagation and potentially ease implementation of timetable changes. Such partitioning inevitably reduces efficiency. To minimize this, determining the groups of lines is crucial for the method. The objective was to minimize the number of vehicles needed to run in the network according to the existing timetable, which was calculated by a Deficit function method. The algorithm, used to approximate the optimal set of groups of lines, started with an initial pseudo-random set of predefined number of groups. This was improved using neighborhood search, moving lines between groups, according to simulated annealing scheme, and with respect to defined constraints. Multiple solutions were proposed for various numbers of groups. Performance of the solutions was tested by creating vehicle and crew schedules using commercial software Hastus. For an objective comparison, schedules were kept without any manual adjustments. The results showed a significant deterioration of efficiency represented by ratio of ‘in-service hours’ to ‘paid hours’ in crew schedules. In one group scenario, efficiency reached 68.8 % while results of scenarios with 2-5 groups showed efficiency between 61.8 % and 63.9 %. Due to made simplifications, it is expected there is space for considerable improvements. For example, the efficiency of the current manually adjusted schedule is 74.2%, 5.4pp higher than the original. Eventually, proposed groups were rated with respect to their potential impact on robustness and punctuality using historical data of passenger demand, punctuality, travel times and disruptions. This impact highly depends on multiple factors and cannot be directly presented in a quantitative way, also for probable impacts on easiness of the scheduling process. The impacts are therefore discussed in a case specific context. Despite a significant decrease of the schedule’s efficiency in the examined case, the method has potential to meet its purpose if certain improvements are implemented: iterative approach of groups definition, including full development of schedules, tailored to the needs and expectations of the application region.",,MB,,,2018-10-29 12:00,0/0,,Nowy

","The frequency of close Vehicle-Pedestrian interactions on major roads is major contributing factor to increasing crash rate, expecially as the number of pedestrians and vehicles increases on the roads. Moreover, pedestrian crash database records available are mostly what can be called medicine after death. A surrogate safety measure is therefore necessary to evaluate safety implications of different intersection traffic control strategies as a means of proactive safety solution. In this research, three traffic control strategies were modelled for a crosswalk incorporated four-way intersection. The traffic network was implemented as unsignalized intersection, signalized fixed time traffic control and as Fuzzy Intelligent Traffic Control (FITC) using VerkehrInStadten-SIMulationsModell (VISSIM) traffic simulator. Trajectory files from the network were analyzed and the potential interaction between vehicles and pedestrians at these intersections were quantified using surrogate safety parameters. The results indicate the safety status of each traffic control strategy. Potential crash rate from the analysis proved a reduction from 2.83% to 0.37% when compared to crash rate computation from Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) crash records.

","ITS systems can take advantage from the use of connected vehicles for managing traffic flow or to extract traffic flow parameters. This paper intends to present a system and some new ideas for the implementation of cooperative ITS systems based on the blockchain concept that has been originated by crypto currencies development and that has been recently introduced and advocated by some companies in supply chain management and Internet of Things. The paper in the first part explores implemented and proposed blockchain based systems in transportation networks and the advantages of having ""connected"" vehicles for traffic regulation and management. In the second part the paper presents a system that, making use of a dedicated Blockchain, is able to involve both drivers and city administrations in the adoption of promising and innovative technologies that will create cooperation among connected vehicles. The proposed blockchain based system can allow city administrators to reward drivers, when they are willing to share travel data, with incentives based on a dedicated cryptocoin. The system manages in a special way the creation of new coins which are assigned to drivers and institutions which are participating actively in the system. Moreover, the system allows keeping a complete track of all transactions and interactions between drivers and city management on a completely open and shared platform. The main idea is to combine mobile technologies (and/or connected vehicles) with Blockchain technology to promote Cooperative ITS use and a better use of infrastructures. In the proposed blockchain the generation of ""traffic coin"" is carried out in the same way as in the bitcoin system, on the base of a ""proof of work"", with the difference that the bitcoin classical ""proof of work"" is modified in the system by substituting the hash calculation with a proof of work based on the vehicles trajectories. Dedicated servers that are operated by the traffic management organizations will be node of the blockchain system. In practical terms the proof of work, for the servers that are operated by the traffic management organizations, becomes the completion and certification of an established number of travelled kilometres certified by the on board devices. The system is able thus to reward ""cooperating"" drivers with a dedicated cryptocurrency. Cooperating drivers would be drivers that carry on the effort to activate, while travelling, some on board device and to share positions with the community in real time The paper exploring blockchain based technologies presents some new possibilities to reward and motivate drivers (or owners of vehicles) to share vehicle position (obtained from satellite localization) in real time with road traffic management organizations.",,VN,,,2018-10-29 14:25,0/0,,Nowy

","Throughout the world, bicycling as a transport mode has seen a significant increase over the past decades and transportation agencies promote bicycling as an alternative transportation option, since it can provide health benefits, reduce carbon emissions, and alleviate congestion. It is imperative then that transportation agencies develop and support an appropriate infrastructure to encourage the continued growth of bicycling. Lack of quality infrastructure is a major impediment to bicycle usage as past research has shown. Factors such as presence of bicycle infrastructure, in the form of bicycle lanes, paths, or cycle tracks, pavement conditions, and roadway safety have been identified as features that could encourage bicycling. Cyclists tend to avoid areas that could pose unsafe conditions and could eventually reduce bicycle use as a transport mode. It is therefore imperative for agencies to identify such locations either with objective or subjective means in order to improve infrastructure and thus encourage cycling. Moreover, social networking and new transportation resources such as bike sharing can be used to supply the lack of traditional crash data in the analysis of bicyclist safety. In this study we used two different survey to explore risk perceptions and observed risk that can be collected by social group surveys and probe data from cycling tracking (e.g. Strava) and observation (e.g. video recording). This study explores perceived and observed risk through the use of two different surveys. Participants were asked to score a series of intersections and routes in terms of perceived safety problems in the city of Catania, Italy, using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from very safe to very dangerous. Observed risk was, instead, was measured during riding tests with an instrumented bike identifying traffic conflicts in the same routes and intersections by video recording and analysis. A spatial analysis of perceived and observed safety was carried out in order to evaluate correlations and capability of both procedures to identify and classify locations with high risk conditions for bicyclists. The study provides evidence on the possibilities to collect information both from users’ pools and probe data that are becoming more and more available in smart cities. Such information can be used as surrogate measure of safety to identify dangerous locations in the urban road network to supply the lack of data about actual crashes involving bicyclists.",,MK,,,2018-10-29 14:47,0/0,,Nowy

","Logistics activities represent a considerable portion of the overall operating costs of a transport organization. Therefore, great attention was paid to the effectiveness of logistics models in order to develop solution frameworks able to optimize transportation costs. The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a very important optimization problem in the areas of transportation logistics and fleet management. It was introduced by Dantzig and Ramser (1959) and it remains one of the most challenging problem of the operations research field. Generally, practitioners took advantage of advances in computational resources and optimization methodologies to solve complex vehicle routing extensions which were considered too difficult in the past. Among all VRP extensions, the VRP with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD) can be considered as one the most important problem in the last mile delivery, where parcels should be collected and distributed. In this work, among the VRPPD variants well-known in the literature, we deal with the VRP with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD). We introduce a complication of the VRPSPD considering also door-to-door (D2D) service, typical in urban logistics. Door-to-door usually refers to a movement of cargo using a single transport mode and without any temporary storage. Thus, we are considering the possibility that a vehicle could serve a request between a pair of origin/destination customers while it is moving in an urban area. Our interest lies in the VRPSPD-D2D subject to capacity constraints and urban traffic conditions. The contribution of this paper also lies in a novel optimization approach to the VRPSPD-D2D based on a two-stage algorithm. The proposed optimization approach takes into account the minimization of the number of vehicles, at the first stage, and the minimization of the route travel cost, at the second one. These two stages are strictly related: the first provides the input (vehicle assignment to orders) to the second stage, and the second provides the cost value of the best route to the first. The aim is to minimize the total travel cost while serving all the uncommitted orders. At each stage, a single objective is solved using a honey bee-inspired metaheuristic. In particular, the first stage is intended to find the optimal assignment of vehicles to customers. In this stage, we used the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), a metaheuristic algorithm especially suitable for assignment problems. The second stage finds the optimal route for each vehicle in order to satisfy all the assigned orders. In other words, this stage is intended to solve a Travelling Salesman Problem, subject to the constraints listed above. It is based on the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO), an algorithm based on the construction of the solution through stages. We tested the resulting optimization system using the Sioux-Falls City network and compared it with two Genetic Algorithm-based approaches.",,VN,,,2018-10-29 14:57,0/0,,Nowy

","The penetration of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEV) in power systems is increasing, which offers a new option for the batteries of these vehicles, that can be used as a Distributed Energy Resource (DER). A DER can provide ancillary services to utilities in interconnected systems or it can also be used in isolated systems as part of Demand Side Management programs (DSM) to modify the load curve. The potential use of this DER depends mainly on the available energy capacity of the PEV batteries connected to the grid. However, the uncontrolled use of the batteries can reduce their life and compromise the PEV autonomy, considering that the main function of the PEV is mobility. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the power capacity of a DER based on PEV batteries and how it can be used in a DSM program to modify the load curve in a low voltage system. In this study, both the user demand and the energy available in the PEV batteries have a stochastic behavior; in addition, the reduction in battery capacity due to the charge – discharge processes is considered. To verify the performance of the proposed methodology, a residential complex located in Bogotá, Colombia was selected as a case study and several simulations were developed. Some of the technical parameters in the electrical system were evaluated, such as the voltage profile, the transformer load curve and the power losses. In addition, the DER power capacity under different vehicle penetration levels was determined. Based on these results, a comparative analysis between the benefit that can be obtained by using this DER and the cost of using the batteries in a DMS program, considering its degradation and useful life was carried out. It is observed that the use of the PEV batteries in DMS programs can lead to its degradation in a very short time, which makes it not an appropriate solution from the economic point of view; however, with an adequate management strategy it is possible to use the batteries as a backup option for certain critical conditions of the system.",,MB,,,2018-10-29 15:13,0/0,,Nowy

","Calibration procedure of traffic microsimulation models can be a very time-consuming process in case of the large-scale and complex network. Among optimization algorithms, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have been considered mostly because of their ease-of-implementation. The limitation of the utilization of single GA and single PSO algorithms is explained and solved in authors’ previous work by proposing a combination of the GA and PSO named hybrid GA and hybrid PSO. Although it showed a successful computational performance, one might consider using parallel computing techniques (PCT) to decrease the computation time of the proposed calibration procedure. The main contribution of this study has been to develop a quick calibration and auto-tuning procedure for the parameters of driving behavior models using evolutionary algorithms (EA) and PCT. In order to test the integration of PCT with the proposed methodology, a segment of the O-1 Highway in Istanbul has been selected as a real-world case study and modeled by mostly-used microscopic simulation software, VISSIM. Parameters of driving behavior models were calibrated by different types of EAs. Macroscopic traffic flow characteristics measured by RTMS detectors were used for validation. In the application of EA, objective function evaluation step for each selected sets of parameters’ values is the main time-consuming step in such calibration problems. EA has to run a simulation and calculate its corresponding objective function value once for each set of parameters. However, using PCT known multi-threading technique, EA can be able to run several separate VISSIM instances simultaneously and calculate several objective function values in parallel. For instance, assume a CPU: Intel Core™ i7 - 2670QM@2.20 GHz with four cores can run four VISSIM instances in parallel, each instance using two cores. Even more, one can use a cluster of several computers to distribute the work among them. This does not mean that calibration time will be just ¼ of the original time, as we have to consider parallelization overhead and the fact that VISSIM itself could use more cores for simulation if allowed. This feature of the proposed methodology can be able to save a significant amount of time during the optimization process by sharing the total computational time among all cores. The proposed method was coded using MATLAB and implemented via the VISSIM-MATLAB COM interface. Two scenarios including with/without PCT were analyzed by developed methodology. Results prove that using an integrated calibration and PCT can reduce the computational time of the optimization process significantly and improve the EA performance in such a complex and large-scale optimization problems. This method will be useful for overcoming the limitation of computational time of existing calibration methods. In this study, we used VISSIM, as simulation software, GA and PSO as EAs; however, the proposed methodology can be easily implemented for other EAs and microsimulation software in the same way.",,VN,,,2018-10-29 23:34,0/0,,Nowy

The problems of station based car-sharing and parking problems could be alleviated using shared autonomous vehicles (SAV). Using SAV will enable travelers to increase the number of activities that they usually perform during the day because of changes in the spent time for parking process (searching for a lot, parking in the lot and walking to the location of the activity) as well as finding the closest car-sharing station. AV systems will affect the arrival and departure time of travelers, especially who use private car. Moreover the utility function for the optimization process of activity chains will be changed because AV have different properties from regular cars, which has an effect on traveler’s activities sequence and travel time, not to mention potential changes in the travel cost. Cost estimations of using AV depends on different factors, for example empty or repositioning driving time, whether AV is shared or not, and size of fleet. In this paper agent-based modeling and simulation of activities will be conducted to study the behavior of travelers using SAV. In the modeling framework distance based fee, shared vehicles, fleet size and capacities of vehicle types will be used. We are defining the acceptable waiting time of predefined user groups of travelers in order to decide whether to use SAV or other transportation modes. Several parameters of the existing utility function will be modified and extended to consider SAV system (for instance preferences for comfort and accessibility, cost and time). Also new parameters will be involved in the model, such as vehicle capacity (type of vehicle), parking spaces (for vehicles not in use), socio-demographic parameters (age, gender, income). Additionally we define user groups (long commute drivers, PT rider, elderly people, high class income, people without license), who have different attitudes and requirements for planning their activities. Simulation of the daily plan of activities will be performed using Multi-agent Transport simulation tool (MATSim), which applies the concept of co-evolutionary algorithm. MATSim process loop will be applied (mobility simulation, scoring and re-planning) for many iterations until the state of system becomes stable. Specific utility function will be used for the scoring step regarding travelers’ plans, which is followed by a Logit selection probability for the re-planning step. The expected shift from private conventional cars and public transport to SAV is approximately 15% and 5%, respectively, while the expected increase of vehicle kilometer is about 10%. Finally percentage of user groups who used SAV are estimated. With the result of this study multimodal simulation of daily behaviour of travelers and their interactions with SAV systems will be presented and analyzed in different ways, for instance evaluating travel time, distance, mode choice. This study will be used as a basis for further studies, as it is built based on theoretical inferences of AV systems.

","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) constitute one of the most rapidly growing sectors, regarding transportation research and its implementation in the wider European territory. The European Union invests in the ITS sector through the Horizon 2020 funding, programme; in the frameworks of which more than 24 projects are active for the 2014-2017 period with a total funding of €140 million. Despite the significance of ITS and C-ITS in the European territory, there is the general assumption that some fundamental knowledge gaps exist in the fields of ITS and C-ITS. Those fragmentations in knowledge lead to delays in the development and dissemination of new ITS and C-ITS technologies. In order to tackle the fragmentations derived from the knowledge gaps of ITS and C-ITS stakeholders, a variety of strategies exist and are applied worldwide, under the term Capacity Development Strategies. For each individual case of knowledge fragmentation, and based on each case’s special needs and requirements, different strategies are applied. The strategies proposed in this study try to bridge all the existing fragmentations in the ITS and C-ITS dissemination process, by providing all the necessary elements and knowledge to the stakeholders, for identifying the appropriate solution. The proposed capacity development strategies are categorised based on the Know-How level of the stakeholders (namely 1st, 2nd and 3rd Know-How level) as well as on the type of the organization (public authorities and ITS/ C-ITS stakeholders). Different strategies are also applied according to the area of responsibility and to geographic terms, for each public authority and/or stakeholder (local and national level authorities). The analysis and identification of the Capacity Development Strategies realized in this paper is based on the analysis and results from a survey conducted among European ITS and C-ITS stakeholders regarding observed knowledge gaps among stakeholders in the ITS sector.",,RK,TAK,"Please, in the full paper, state the research problem addressed in this study.

","Developments in the fields of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) are continuous and new innovative technological solutions for the provision of more accurate and trustworthy feedback are employed on a regular basis. The last decade, the European Union has funded more than 140 million euros for research in innovative ITS and C-ITS technologies through the HORIZON 2020 funding mechanism. Taking into account the significance of ITS and C-ITS technologies, in the frameworks of the CAPITAL project, an ITS knowledge database has been introduced in order for a common framework to be provided for the deployment of ITS and C-ITS. The ITS knowledge database is presented in the form of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) through the CAPITAL Online Training Platform, developed in the standards of other online training platforms. The solution of MOOCs has been chosen due to the fact that more and more platforms, either university platforms or not, are already introduced for providing educational programs. The ITS knowledge database consists of nine independent topic studies, with each one aiming to describe the current state of the art of ITS and C-ITS. The aforementioned topic studies are the following: - Introduction to ITS and C-ITS; - Communication technologies for ITS and C-ITS including relevant standards; - TMC and roadside technologies for ITS; - ITS and C-ITS user services; - Impact assessment of ITS and impacts of selected ITS and C-ITS systems; - Financial incentives, business models and procurement models for C-ITS deployment; - Cost-benefit analyses of ITS services; - Guidance in deploying ITS and C-ITS; - Data protection and privacy. The topic studies mainly take the form of literature reviews and they are presented as video lectures. They address all ITS stakeholders, divided by their know-how level into three categories: 1st level ITS start-up communities, 2nd level intermediary communities and 3rd level professional users. The educational and informational material is customized for each individual know-how level. Every trainee has the possibility to evaluate the concept of online training tools as well as the effectiveness of this specific tool both before and after the attendance to each course. Moreover, various quizzes have been developed based on the material of each lecture separately in order to measure the level of knowledge and the information that the trainees gain after each lecture. Within this paper, a first thorough analysis of the feedback of the participants – trainees is being presented and a consequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the platform is being executed in order to identify the efficiency and the success of such an online tool. The level of awareness and demand for ITS technologies is being measured through descriptive statistics that conclude to useful results for both the material of the courses as well as the usefulness of an online training tool for ITS.",,VN,,,2018-10-30 09:57,0/0,,Nowy

","On-demand transport services has become a common mode of transport with ride-sourcing provided by companies like Uber, Lyft and Didi as a prime example. With the increase in popularity of such services, service supply needs to adapt dynamically to incoming passenger demand. Demand anticipatory fleet dispatching and rebalancing strategies can potentially improve operational efficiency as well as reduce passenger waiting times. To this end, it is essential to examine the extent to which demand patterns are recurrent and hence predictable. In this study, we propose three steps for extracting demand patterns from travel request data: (1) determining the set of origin-destination zones by means of spatial clustering (2) constructing the hourly origin-destination matrix for each day, and (3) performing temporal clustering to identify the underlying dynamic demand patterns. With travel requests for ride-sourcing services in the hundreds of thousands per day in large urban areas, methods to decrease the dimensionality of the demand computation need to be employed. We aggregate pick-up and drop-off locations into zones using k-means based on a distance and flow metric. The clustering aims at minimising the distance from the points to centroids of the zones while maximising the flow (i.e. number of trips) between the zones. With these static zones as the origins and destinations, we can compute the OD matrix to represent the demand. Each cell in the OD matrix corresponds to the number of trips completed within a time period from a particular origin zone to a particular destination zone. The OD matrix can be used to understand where the demand is produced and attracted with respect to the zones and also for extensive descriptive analysis of the demand data. For studying this further, we use these OD matrices as feature vectors for the temporal clustering using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This clustering is used to study if there are patterns emerging for three cases – (i) different hours of the month, (ii) different days of the month, and (iii) different hours of the day. These insights can aid in building a demand-oriented fleet management for different time periods within a day and also for different days as well as shed light on an insofar unknown demand distribution property. We demonstrate the three step approach on the open-source Didi taxi data. The data is composed of 1 month (November 2016) of travel requests data from a small area in Chengdu, China with approximately 200 000 rides for a single day on average. This data set provides insight into the day-to-day regularity and within-day regularity of the demand patterns in Chengdu.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-30 11:34,0/0,,Nowy

","Stochastic Multi-Vehicle Assignment To Urban Transportation Networks Giulio E. Cantarella, University of Salerno, DICIV, Italy Angela Di Febbraro, University of Genova, DIME, Italy Massimo Di Gangi, University of Messina, DipIng, Italy Orlando Giannattasio, University of Genova, DIME, Italy (listed in alphabetic order) This paper deals with assignment to an urban transportation network, where paths likely overlap; several types of vehicles sharing same arcs and jointly affecting congestion are considered, restricted access arcs may be considered as well. Several considerations support this enhancement of existing assignment methods. Among them, the fast developing technologies for advanced vehicles such connected, automated, autonomous vehicles (AVs). Several years will be required to substitute the current stock of (privately owned) human drive traditional vehicles (TVs). Thus enhanced methods for analysing mixed traffic are needed to support transportation project assessment and evaluation. This paper focuses on stochastic assignment methods, where user route choice behaviour is modelled through models derived from Random Utility T¬¬¬¬heory to model several sources of uncertainty, such as user perception errors, aggregation errors and missing attributes by the modeller, etc . Probit choice model, assuming that perceived utilities are distributed as a MV Normal random variable, and Gammit choice model, assuming that perceived utilities are distributed as a MV Gamma random variable, allow for any covariance matrix to properly address path overlapping. Still, no closed form is available for choice probabilities derived from these choice models, thus Montecarlo techniques based on a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) are commonly used to specify solution algorithms for stochastic assignment to uncongested networks (SUN). This problem is interesting as such, but even more as a part of fixed-point models for stochastic user equilibrium assignment (SUE) to congested networks. Algorithms based on the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) are the most used to solve these fixed-point models, since they are suitable for large scale applications, when explicit path enumeration may not be available. Their basic iteration requires: (i) get arc costs from arc flows through the cost functions (ii) get arc flows from arc costs through a SUN in this order or in reverse order. Generally MSA-based algorithms do not provide the equilibrium arc flow pattern in finite number of iterations, but only provide a succession of arc flow patterns; sufficient conditions for theoretical convergence of such a succession may be derived through the Blum theorem. This paper, an extension of a paper presented at ETC 2018 by the same authors, aims at specifying methods for SUN and SUE. • Regarding Montecarlo algorithms for SUN: the efficiency of the commonly used Mersenne-Twister PRNG, already analysed, will be compared with a PRNG based on Sobol (quasi-random) numbers. • Regarding MSA-based algorithms for SUE: the efficiency of the basic MSA step size strategy, already analysed, will be compared with more advanced strategies aiming at improving practical rate of convergence; sufficient convergence conditions will be discussed considering arc cost flow functions with symmetric or asymmetric Jacobian matrix. An application to a real scale network will be discussed to support theoretical results.",main original contribution of this paper with respect to the quoted ETC2018 paper: - Montecarlo algorithms based on a PRNG based on Sobol (quasi-random) numbers - MSA-based algorithms based on advanced step size strategies - application to real scale,RK,TAK,,2018-10-30 12:47,0/0,,Nowy

","Vehicle automation is progressively introduced in transport networks mostly via Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) that help the driver in the driving process. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is one of the most discussed systems as it is designed to take control of the longitudinal vehicle movement and to adjust the vehicle speed maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The driver has the ability to choose the desired time headway and maximum desired speed. The increasing penetration rate of ACC-enabled vehicles in the transport networks and the lack of publicly-available information over their functionality initiated a discussion over their potential impact in traffic flows upon mass deployment. This work is the continuation of a preliminary discussion over the estimated response time of the ACC controllers. Empirical results in low speeds show that the response time of an ACC controller is comparable to the corresponding reaction time of a human driver and by no means instantaneous [1]. The present work performs an extended empirical study trying to: a) estimate ACC response time in highway speeds; b) compare ACC controllers from different manufacturers in terms of their response times, and c) show preliminary results on the controllers’ stability in platoon formation of three vehicles. In order to provide insights on the above questions, we performed an experimental campaign over a predefined path from the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra to Cherasco, Italy with three vehicles driving in platoon formation. The leading vehicle is manually-driven but the two following ones are driven by two different commercially available ACC systems. All vehicles were equipped with the same-type, commercial, multi-constellation GNSS receivers, able to collected GNSS data with a 10 Hz measurement rate. The response times of the controllers are computed using the methodology presented in [1]. The preliminary findings pose concerns on the impact of ACC on traffic flow when a significant number of vehicles will have such systems operating on-board. The ACC controllers are designed with an evident priority to the passenger and their feeling of safety and comfort, as large time headways and response times with values comparable to that of the human drivers, produce smoother and more comfortable trajectories.

","In the last years many Big Data technologies have been applied to the transportation sector all over the world. Despite existing and future promising applications, critical factors which lead to a successful application and value generation from Big Data technologies in transport are largely unknown. The European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 (H2020) NOESIS project aims at identifying critical features leading to the successful implementation of Big Data technologies and services in the field of transport. In order to accomplish that aim, key challenges of Big Data utilization in the transport domain, need to be initially identified. The scope of this paper is to present the research findings on the major Big Data in Transportation challenges. The NOESIS challenges describe the major transportation areas and sub-problems that could benefit by Big Data. Firstly, a literature review was conducted in order to obtain the main areas (challenges) within the transportation domain which have the potential of greater exploitation through Big Data methods. 10 initial focus areas were identified from reviewing the state-of-the-art in Big Data and transportation research. Secondly, findings from the literature review were discussed and validated during a workshop with experts on Big Data in Transportation, increasing those challenges to 13. For each of the focus areas, corresponding sub-problems have been also identified. The derived NOESIS challenges were found to be: 1. Environment and Health 2. Automation 3. Safety and security 4. Transport management and operation 5. Transport policy and planning 6. Freight and logistics 7. Integration with emphasis on Mobility as a Service (MaaS) 8. Funding, Financing, Cost efficiency 9. Social / Psychological aspects 10. Data related 11. Quality of service 12. Resilience 13. Maintenance The findings of this paper contribute to the exploitation of Big Data within transportation in two ways: i) it provides the necessary literature review and experts’ discussion for identifying the transport domain areas in which big data technologies could be successfully applied and ii) it identifies sub-problems linked to each of the challenges that big data could help to improve transportation. As a result, it is believed that this work initiates a first step towards enhancing the socioeconomic impact of transportation investments using Big Data.",,RK,TAK,"Interesting project and abstract proposal.

","The idea of dynamic bus lanes (DBL) has been known for years. Many authors tried to estimate the potential benefits of such a solution. The main assumption of the DBL system is to activate exclusive bus lane (XBL) when a bus approaches the segment and deactivate XBL when bus leaves the segment making the lane available to all road users. The new solution requires additional infrastructure like variable message signs and in-pavement lights, informing drivers whether the DBL is active or not. Also, there is a need to use a properly developed ICT system for detecting buses approaching the designated section. One of the popular tools to evaluate a new solution is a microscopic traffic simulation model. Unfortunately, the available software has some limitations. One of them is lack of special modules for simulating the activation and deactivation process of the DBL. The authors of existing publications didn't describe how they solved this problem. Therefore, in this paper the authors propose a new method for modelling DPA control in the PTV Vissim environment. The paper describes two ways to simulate the DBL process – a simplified method and a detailed method. The simplified approach is based on typical functions available in the software. This method requires to develop two models which represent an option with the existing traffic without XBL and one with the XBL. The results for the option with DBL were obtained indirectly in two stages. The first stage was to determine the total activation time needed to give priority to all buses during the analyzed time period. The second stage was to define the average travel time of cars when the exclusive bus lane was active and when the DBL system was inactive. In the detailed approach method it is possible to perform a full simulation of DBL operation. To do this it is necessary to place additional connectors in the road network model and create special routing decisions which allow vehicles to enter the right traffic lane at a given time interval. To control this process it is also necessary to include a special signal controller to implement an appropriate algorithm for the DBL system. For this purpose, several detection zones need to be introduced. It is important to determine when the bus is approaching and leaving the analyzed segment. Microscopic traffic simulation models developed for one of the street sections in Rzeszów allowed to compare the results obtained with the simplified and detailed methods. The detailed method enabled testing of the new DBL control logic and comparing it with the typical algorithm found in the literature. In addition, the ability to perform full DBL simulation allows one to optimize the DBL system logic. Finally, the results show that differences in cumulative time delay obtained with the simplified and detailed methods were within 20%. It is very important to perform a full DBL simulation process in cases when detailed operational analyzes are carried out. However, at the planning stage, the simplified method will be sufficient.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-30 14:31,0/0,,Nowy

","This paper proposes a new model to evaluate the impacts of systematic mobility in the framework of CSR. According to Freeman’s Theory (1984) three stakeholders will be considered: employers, the whole community (externalities) and the company itself. Costs and benefits produced by 5 different modes of transport (Car, Motorbike, Transit, Walking, Bicycle) are assumed proportional to the distance covered in daily commuting trips and accounted in the CSR Report in line with the international guideline ISO26000 through a triple bottom line optic: social, environmental and monetary (Elkington, 1999). In order to allow employees to participate in the working activities, companies generate a large number of individual trips, although smart working could be an appealing alternative when possible. Therefore, commuting is often to be considered a core problem in the Corporate Mobility Management. In this work we propose to integrate a Balance Sheet component within a more complex modeling framework (implemented in the software MobilityManager), which is capable to simulate through a multinomial logit model of mode choice how mobility impacts can be reduced through soft measurements that are aimed at changing users’ behavior. Starting with a company survey performed exploiting users’ mobile devices, the unitary parameter obtained for each kind of impact through statistics and calibration is then multiplied for the distance covered by each employer with a microscopic disaggregated approach. Besides introducing the structure of the model we demonstrate its effectiveness by presenting a real case study in Fano, Italy. Sensitivity and multi-criteria analysis have been both conducted to estimate the most suitable project scenario.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-30 15:22,0/0,,Nowy

","The emergence of ride-sourcing services, brought about by the advancements in various ICT platforms, is changing the way people travel in urban areas. Such systems offer on-demand service (door-to-door or stop-to-stop, private or shared) to passengers as opposed to line/schedule based public transport services. In addition to providing on-demand services to passengers, past studies suggested that such services could effectively absorb the demand for private cars thereby reducing network congestion and demand for parking. Notwithstanding, the potential of ride-sourcing to absorb public transport demand have largely being overlooked. This study investigates the potential of ride-sourcing services to absorb the demand for public transport and private cars. Ride-sourcing is conceived in this study as a pool of vehicles controlled by a central dispatching system offering door-to-door service. An iterative network loading is performed using MATSim, an agent based simulation model. The model is developed and implemented for the network of Amsterdam. The population is around 800,000 and a scaled down population of 20% is simulated. The simulated modes are car, walk, bike, public transport (metro, tram, and bus), and ride-sourcing services. The simulation scenarios considered are: 1. Base scenario: Car, public transport, walk, and bike are simulated till equilibrium (stable demand for all the modes) 2. Scenario A: Varying supply levels of ride-sourcing services to absorb demand for public transport and private cars. The performance index to measure the level of service is average passenger travel time Initial results for Scenario A (public transport demand absorbed by ride-sourcing services) indicates that level of service comparable to the base scenarios with respect to door-to-door time is attained by a fleet size of 1417 (1% of total demand). Level of service with respect to stop-to-stop time is attained by a fleet of 2834 (2% of total demand). The average travel time stabilises for increased fleet sizes without yielding benefits for passengers, indicating that the public transport demand in the base case is served well by a fleet size of 2834 ride-sourcing vehicles. For the case where demand for cars is absorbed by ride-sourcing, average travel time stabilises beyond fleet size of 4251 (3% of the total demand) while providing marginally lower travel time than offered by car in the base case. However, this fleet size is 10 times lower than the number of private cars in the base case. Additional analysis will include investigating supply levels of ride-sourcing services to provide comparable levels of service of public transport sub-networks (bus and tram) and the impact of ride-sharing services (simultaneously shared). The results provide valuable insights to transport practitioners and operators and the potential scalability of ride-sourcing services.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-30 15:31,0/0,,Nowy

","Holding has been proven to be an effective station control strategy to regulate the operation of bus lines however it comes with the cost of an increased travel time. In the frame of inter station strategies, operator can instruct a driver to adjust the vehicle’s speed or can provide traffic signal priority (TSP). The latter prioritizes PT causing significant delays to the rest of the traffic at signalized intersections. Thanks to the advances of Advanced Public Transport Systems (APTS) and specifically to technologies that allow Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication manage to mitigate stop and go at signalized intersections and reduce potential delays to traffic. Driver advisory systems (DAS) are introduced instructing vehicles to either wait for additional time at stops (GLODTA) or adjust their speed to traverse an intersection during green (GLOSA). So far, holding has been combined with GLODTA to regulate the headways of a line while the number of stops at traffic lights is reduced. While hybrid controllers including holding and speed adjustment have been tested, they haven’t included the delay at signalized intersections and speed advisory is focusing only on recovering from holding time. We propose a hybrid controller which consists of holding and a Driving Advisory System to combine their objectives seeking the regularization of operation and the reduction of stop and go actions at signalized intersections. A simple headway based holding criterion is applied at stops accounting for the preceding and the succeeding vehicle while the maximum allowed limited based on the planned headway. In addition, GLOSA is applied to provide candidate speeds in order to traverse during green indication. The time a vehicle is held is decided in conjunction with the time needed for the vehicle to reach and cruise with the green light optimal speed advisory. Transit Signal Priority (TSP) can be requested as a green recall or extension to ensure that both objectives will be achieved. The criterion is tested using simulation for bus line 16 of the city of Luxembourg, Luxembourg. The criterion is compared to a benchmark scenario, the single application of bus holding and GLODTA. A set of scenarios with different level of TSP (no TSP, weak TSP and strong TSP) is also conducted for each of the different control scenarios. The evaluation of the performance is based on regularity indicators and indicators of the travel time on the links.",,MB,,,2018-10-30 16:10,0/0,,Nowy

","Parking search is a highly relevant problem in many cities. Parking Guidance and Information (PGI) systems support drivers by recommending locations and routes with higher chance to find parking. However, the relevance of such systems for on-street parking spaces is barely studied. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of providing drivers with different parking information to the search. Based on real-world on-street parking data from San Francisco, we investigated the scenario in which a driver does not find a parking space at the destination and has to decide on the next road to go. We consider three different scenarios: (I) No parking information; (II) static information about the capacity of a road segment and temporary parking limitations; (III) real-time information collected from stationary sensors. Clearly the latter has strong implications in terms of deployment and operational costs. These scenarios lead to three different guidance strategies for a PGI system. The empirical experiments we conducted on real on-street parking data from San Francisco show that there is a significant reduction of parking search with more informed strategies, and that the use of real-time information offers only a limited improvement over static one.",,RK,,,2018-10-30 16:21,0/0,,Nowy

","Dynamic OD Estimation (DODE) is usually formulated as bi-level optimization problem problem that is non-convex and non-linear, whose objective function cannot be represented analytically in terms of the OD values. Therefore, it is non-differentiable with respect to the OD values. Furthermore, the function, cannot be computed analytically and, consequently, it must usually be numerically evaluated by simulation, which makes the problem a natural candidate for simulation-optimization methods. Nevertheless, the bi-level optimization approach is usually considered the most convenient formulation adjustment of OD matrices combining available sources of data, because it takes explicitly into account the congestion effects that influence the use of paths between OD pairs. The most common formulation considers that the available sources of data are a historical OD matrix, usually available from a household survey or a former demand model, and traffic volumes, link flow counts measured by detection stations at a subset of links in the network. The problem is then formulated as an optimization problem where the differences between historical OD and traffic counts and the corresponding simulated values are minimized. The underlying hypothesis is that the link flows are predicted by an assignment of the demand matrix X onto the network, which can be expressed by a proportion of the OD demand flows x_nr passing through the count location at link l at time period t, in terms of an assignment matrix A(X), function of the demand X. The assignment matrix represents the fractions of the OD demand x_nr of n OD-pair departing at time interval r that passes link l at time interval. Depending on how the problem is formulated, it can be taken as an iterative approximation, which can numerically be solved analytically, or by simulation-optimization approaches, depending on how the estimated link flows are approximated in terms of the assignment matrix A(X) of the current iteration. Two numerical approaches have been investigated in this paper. An analytical one, expanding the Spiess method to the dynamic case and a simulation-optimization approach based on SPSA (Stochastic Perturbation Stochastic Approximation) a derivative-free method that can easily incorporate non conventional inputs as travel times provided by emerging sensors exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and it is not limited to the inputs from conventional traffic counts. Previous works has analysed the computational performance, quality and sensitivity of the OD adjustment using measures of the structural similarity between the historical and the adjusted ODs. This paper introduces detection layout setting as a critical component affecting performance and solution quality. Numerical experiments are being conducted with real networks and the results will be analysed with the aim of understanding and quantifying how the percentage of captured demand from detection layout and traffic counts correlation affect the behaviour of the SPSA and Spiess-like algorithms. Several goodness of fit indicators are monitored for each experiment: MAPE, Total number of trips, R2, and similarity measures (MSSIM). Additionally, the speed of convergence, stability and CPU performance are also taken into account.",Formulas were removed from the text.,VN,,,2018-10-30 16:30,0/0,,Nowy

","Modern vehicles are pervasively equipped with multiple sensors meant to improve in-vehicle quality of life, efficiency and safety. The aggregation on a remote back-end of the information collected from these sensors may give rise to one of the biggest and most pervasive sensor networks around the world, making possible to extract new knowledge, or contextual awareness, in a detail never experienced before. Anyhow, an open issue with probe vehicles is the achievable spatio-temporal sensing coverage, since vehicles are not uniformly distributed in space and time over the road network. In this paper we present an empirical evaluation of the suitability of a high-mileage vehicles as probes for crowd-sensing. In particular, by leveraging some public datasets of trajectories, we investigated the spatio-temporal coverage that could be obtained by exploiting three different fleets, composed respectively of taxis, buses, and a combination of the two. This empirical analysis was done in two pretty different urban scenarios, namely San Francisco (USA), and Rome (Italy).

","C-ITS has seen increased interest in recent years, with several ongoing activities and first practical implementations. While V2X-communication will play a significant role in all C-ITS deployments, several key components, such as the wireless communication technology and the message formats, are still evolving. This calls for a modular approach when designing C-ITS infrastructure, especially when considering a real world urban environment. Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous traffic light hardware and traffic management systems further increasing the demand for a modular design. This paper focuses on the modular architecture of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden. For example, a highly flexible C-ITS communication stack, was developed for this special purpose. It fully supports the message types standardized by ETSI on the one hand, while on the other hand allowing the rapid implementation and test of new message types and contents. This went hand in hand with the development of a modular roadside unit, enabling the rapid implementation of service applications on its central processing unit. In combination with a high-performance backend including cloud applications and services a real-time C-ITS service platform with a hybrid communication concept was established. This paper presents best practice guidelines based on experiences of the C-ITS pilot in Dresden as well as first results of research topics. The required frameworks including for example information of latency, availability and reliability are shown. The results, based on the already existing Day-1 services, give an impression of the potential of connected and automated driving. The ongoing C-ITS deployment in Dresden is part of the initiative “Synchrone Mobilität 2023”, which aims at advancing Intelligent Transport Systems. Focusing on automated and connected driving in urban areas, the research and development projects under its umbrella initiate scientific and technological developments and provide comprehensive test facilities. Automated and connected driving in urban areas requires not only simulations and test drives on test sites but also enormous testing effort under real traffic conditions. The Dresden Testbed offers outstanding conditions for the multitude of test kilometres and the experience of different traffic scenarios.",,RK,,,2018-10-30 17:13,0/0,,Nowy

","One of the basic elements of the assessment of the functioning of public transport is the assessment of its punctuality. The basic and traditional source of data on punctuality is the results of field tests, during which observers note the departure times of public transport vehicles (trams, buses etc.) from stops. Comparison of measurement results with timetables is the basis for the above-mentioned assessment. However, such works are expensive and time-consuming, and their results only concern local observations. What's more, the results of these observations make it difficult to indicate the reasons for the results - usually delays in public transport service. Currently, the results of the above-mentioned research can be supported with the use of data on the current location of transport means on the base of ITS systems. The use of GPS devices together with online data transmission as part of GPRS enables the current collection of data on the position of all public transport vehicles. These data are usually entered into the ITS database, and thus monitored by traffic control services. Bearing in mind the fact that these data are collected on an ongoing basis and concern all public transport vehicles, it seems reasonable to apply these data to detailed analyzes of the functioning of public transport service. Area of potential application of the above data may relate to a number of transport issues, including punctuality of transport means. In addition, it enables to indicate the causes of disturbances, including places that have a special impact on the disturbances observed. The main goal of the article is to indicate the reliability of data on the location of public transport vehicles from the ITS system, and thus their potential suitability for solving problems in the functioning of public transport service. The analyzes presented in the article are based on field studies and data from the ITS system in the medium Polish city.

","Electric mobility has a fundamental role in the domain of sustainable transport solutions due to its capacity to reduce pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions, especially in large urban areas. With the increasing number of electric vehicles, the development and application of methods and tools supporting the planning of charging infrastructures and the optimal management of energy demand on the electric grid are particularly important. In this context of study, we propose the implementation and testing of a simulation model for the analysis and evaluation of scenarios related to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in urban transport networks. The proposed simulator is conceived as a new tool to support governance for energy management, both in the design (location and sizing) of the charging station network and in the study of traffic management and technological solutions for smart charging. The simulator includes functions for estimating the impact of e-mobilty on electric demand with a high spatio-temporal resolution. It also helps to analyze V2G (vehicle-to-grid) scenarios allowing energy to flow both to and from the vehicle and enabling smart-charging solutions and renewable energy use. Moreover, the simulator can evaluate multimodal mobility scenarios coming from the introduction of measures aimed at favouring Park & Ride near stations or public transport stops, thus reducing the travelled distances by car and distributing the energy demand among the different zones of the city. We chose the metropolitan city of Rome, Italy, as the reference area for the study and the definition of the simulator. The models behind the simulator use extensive collections of geo-referenced traffic data carried out by a monthly sample of 150’000 tracked vehicles, as well as open data related to the planned service and the network structure of the public transport service of the city. The backbone of the system is a synthetic trajectory generator trained so to be able to reproduce aggregated trips between different zones of the city. The model is also capable of reproducing other statistical patterns extracted from the geo-referenced data such as the distribution of parked vehicles in each area, the distribution of the trajectories’ gyration radius, the exploration rate of novel areas. The synthetic trajectories are then used as an input to a recharge behaviour model simulating the interaction between electric-vehicles, the existing charging spots and the power-grid. The recharge behaviour model includes different kinds of electric-vehicles with different consumption profiles and battery capacities and it interacts with the multimodal model in order to incorporate the possibility for electric car drivers to perform Park & Ride during their daily dynamics. The multimodal model has been calibrated and tested through a data-driven approach based on a machine learning method (Random Forest). Results suggest that the model succeeds in simulating Park & Ride behaviours by showing a mean average percentage error between the model and the data of about 30% with a correlation (R2) of about 0.9.",,VN,,,2018-10-30 18:13,0/0,,Nowy

","The increasing availability of historical Floating Car Data (that is vehicle trajectories collected using for example on-board GPS units) allows to better build and calibrate model-based traffic forecasting systems. A precise estimation of origin–destination (O–D) matrices is critical for the successful application of these models. This papers develops an innovative off – line methodology in order to calibrate the origin–destination (O–D) matrices, under the condiction that traffic counts and a data set of FCD are both avaible. A data driven approach allows to estimate the observed O/D matrices, to compute turn probabilities at intersections and generation shares in traffic zones, and to reconstruct aggregated paths shares over the network. These informations are the input for estimate the “Assignment Matrix” that describes the real route choice behaviour. An O/D matrix correction methodology (by TFlowFuzzy procedure . Van Zuylen/Willumsen (1980), Bosserhoff (1985) and Rosinowski (1994)) is then carried out exclusively using as inputs the “Assignment Matrix” and the traffic counts. The methodology is applicable to real size network and it has been successfully tested on the network of Turin. Therefore, the proposed approch has been implemented within a existing traffic management center via PTV Optima product. The methodology minimizies any manual and specialized effort to build, calibrate and maintain transportation demand models.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-30 18:39,0/0,,Nowy

","On congestion or incident-prone motorway sections, line control systems can contribute to improving traffic safety as well as to mitigating traffic breakdowns. With line control systems, traffic control measures such as variable speed limits, lane signals, passing restrictions and warnings may be applied to a section of motorway via variable message signs. Such control measures are mostly triggered automatically in response to the prevailing traffic and weather situation. The effects of line control systems on traffic flow and (collective) driving behavior have already been studied comprehensively. However, line control systems have only very rarely been analyzed in a microscopic traffic simulation. One major issue is the calibration of the effects certain variable message sign states have in a given situation. On the one hand, multiple messages and control strategies may overlap, making it difficult to distinguish their individual effects. On the other hand, surrounding traffic and weather conditions must be considered, as well. This paper presents a new approach to model the effects of line control systems on the driving behavior of individual vehicle-driver units in a microscopic traffic simulation. Various influencing factors as well as driver model parameters are modeled as state variables (nodes) of a Bayesian Network, which is trained based on field data of multiple years from three different motorway sections across Germany that are equipped with line control systems. This paper describes the modeling methodology, including calibration and validation, and outlines the results of the modeling process. Furthermore, this paper describes how the model interacts with the microscopic traffic simulation at runtime, and briefly discusses potential use cases of this approach. The approach will be used in a research project on behalf of the German Federal Highway Research Institute, where the human driving behavior within a line control system will be compared to the behavior of certain percentages of automated vehicles. In addition, it may also be used to enable microscopic traffic simulation as a tool for quality assurance and optimization of line control systems.",,RK,TAK,Very interesting and significant problem with sound methodolgy (promised) hope to see it in the full paper.,2018-10-31 07:24,0/0,,Nowy

","In the next decades of transition to full automation, roads will be shared by Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and human drivers. The behaviour of both types of road users, focusing on the interactions, is of great importance for road safety. More specifically, although autonomous vehicles have the potential to offer several important benefits, such as no distraction, emotions, fatigue, poor or clouded judgment, cognitive impairments, enhanced perception of the road environment and of each other, their behaviour does not always resemble that of human drivers. The potential negative implication of this is that human drivers might be confused by the unintuitive behaviour of the automated vehicles, potentially leading to road safety problems. In order to deal with this important issue, driving behaviour of both human drivers and autonomous vehicles should be thoroughly analysed. Based on the above, the objective of this research is to develop a Turing Test-like procedure, aiming to assess the driving behaviour of both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Ideally, it should be impossible to distinguish an autonomous vehicle from a human-driven vehicle, based only on external observations about its driving behaviour. For this purpose, driving simulation data will be extracted through a carefully designed driving simulator experiment representing a car following and a lane change scenario, both for human drivers and autonomous vehicles in different road environments (urban/motorway). Next, a framework for verifying (or not) that an AV is indeed and AV (following Turing test-like principles) will be developed. The basis of the Turing Test is that a human interrogator is asked to distinguish which of two options is a computer, and which is a real human. If the interrogator cannot distinguish computer from human, then the computer is considered to have passed the test successfully. In the present research, a user will select a driving environment to investigate and two outputs will be presented based on respective datasets. If the user cannot indicate the differences between autonomous vehicle and human driving outputs, then the Turing test for Autonomous Vehicles is considered to be successful. The present research aims to address road safety policy makers by providing evidence-based information about autonomous vehicles and, based on that, by estimating an indication of whether the examined autonomous vehicle could be adapted to imitate human driver behaviour. Furthermore, this research will also address key industry stakeholders and public by improving road safety.",,RK,TAK,"Very interesting problem, worth researching.

","Objective: The objective of this work is to summarize recent research developments in terms of traffic simulation models for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Based on the review, the study presents key findings regarding model representation and parameterization of CAVs and gives insights for future research directions. Motivation: Research interest in CAVs has been growing substantially in recent years, and there is an abundant amount of literature findings regarding the potential impacts of CAVs on travel safety, network performance, interactions in a mixed traffic conditions, travel behavior etc. However, the majority of such studies employ various assumptions regarding their methodological framework, scenario evaluation and analysis settings. Consequently, a proper standardization of these studies is missing. Furthermore, these research studies have formulated numerous modelling approaches to describe the CAVs traffic, which yet vary significantly as with regards to the traffic model, CAVs dynamics representation, input and calibration parameters. Hence, the CAV-related works tend to differ substantially in their output observations and conclusions, which causes uncomparable, not transferable study results. Scope/method: This work is concerned with an in-depth literature review, which reveals the state-of-the-art research achievements regarding simulation models developed for CAVs traffic and their underlying methodological assumptions. Specifically, the variable input and control parameters which are relevant in describing the traffic dynamics and mutual interactions of CAVs are analysed. Such an important issue lacks to-date proper standardization in CAVs research, as studies utilize manifold parameters, some of which are either of minor importance for CAVs modelling purposes or have contradictory impact upon each other. Moreover, key observations from current simulation studies are compared and contrasted with regards to their major findings – gathered both from individual case studies, as well as formulated as network-wide implications of future CAVs mobility. Results/contribution: The key contribution of this paper is a comprehensive summary of state-of-the-art developments in CAVs modelling – in particular, development of simulation models for CAVs. This paper forms an attempt to standardize the main achievements in fields of modelling approaches formulated for description of CAVs traffic dynamics and input control parameterization. Importantly, this paper paves the way for conducting modelling studies on CAVs with transferable results and external validity. This will lead to more coherent and realistic research on CAVs. Moreover, results summarized in this paper underline the probable implications of CAVs vehicles, shed more light on their potential performance in various network conditions and thus, indicate possible means of effective management of CAVs traffic. It is envisioned that conclusions from this study will comprise a beneficial contribution to the rapidly advancing stream of research works, dedicated to the eventual prospect of a fully automated future mobility, as well as interesting aspects of the transition period.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 09:30,0/0,,Nowy

","Call Detail Records (CRDs) provide the operator with an incredible amount of information on its customers' whereabouts and movement. Using the collected data, it is possible to apply sequential analysis techniques to reconstruct customers' movement trajectories. Due to multiple factors affecting the signal emitted by the antennas, the coverage area fluctuates and it is non-static. In addition, the coverage of multiple antennas does overlap and cover one geographic area due to the original design of cellular networks. This creates a situation where cellphones geographically close to each other can be connected to different antennas due to handover rule - the operator hands over a certain cellphone to another antenna to spread the load between antennas. Hence, this aspect introduces a ping-pong handover phenomena in the trajectories extracted from the CDR data which can be very misleading in understanding the movement pattern. To reconstruct accurate trajectories it is a must to reduce the number of those handovers appearing in the dataset. This paper presents a novel approach for filtering ping-pong handovers from CDR based trajectories. Primarily, the approach is based on anchors model utilizing different features and parameters extracted from the coverage areas and reconstructed trajectories mined from the CDR data. Using this methodology we can significantly reduce the ping-pong handover noise in the trajectories, which gives a more accurate reconstruction of the customers' movement pattern.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 09:35,0/0,,Nowy

","Knowing where to park in advance is a most wished feature by many drivers. In recent years, many research efforts have been spent to analyse massive amount of parking information, to learn availability trends and thus to predict, within a Parking Guidance and Information (PGI) system, where there is the highest chance to find free parking spaces. The most of these solutions exploits raw data coming from stationary sensors or crowd-sensed by mobile probes. In both the cases, these massive amounts of data present a high level of noise, which heavily affects the quality of availability predictions. In a previous work we demonstrated that a 2-step approach, based on machine learning techniques to filter out noise, improves the quality of parking availibility predictions in a statistically significant way, over raw data. In this paper we propose a further advancement of that approach, by studying different techniques to perform such noise filtering in real-time, with reduced computational efforts. These techniques have been empirically tested on a real-world dataset of on-street parking information from the SFpark project, and compared against a regression model based on SVR, to perform parking availability predictions. Results show that the predictions obtained with the new real-time approach are comparable with the ones of the 2-step solution, still showing a statistically significant improvement with respect to the use of raw data coming from the sensors, while requiring a fraction of computational resources. Thus, the proposed real-time approach can easily be scaled to a city-wide context.",,RK,TAK,Both the problem is interesting and the methods used.

","The paper is aimed to developing the theoretical sensitivity analysis of the CapTA model of traffic assignment to a transit network (Leurent et al., 2014). This model has a three-layered architecture as follows: from bottom up, (i) the “vehicle loading model” features out a vehicle running along the sequence of stations in its service route to unload and load passenger flows: in-vehicle crowding induces comfort conditions, which combined to vehicle run times between stations determine the generalized travel costs to users by origin-destination pair. (ii) the “line model” deals with one or several service routes sharing part or all of a specific traffic infrastructure: a “track occupancy” sub-model interplays with the “run model” applied to every route and with the “platform bottleneck” sub-model of passenger boarding at every station along the line. (iii) the “network model” deals with passenger route choice on the entire network of lines and establishes a static, capacity-restrained user equilibrium of traffic. A first step of sensitivity analysis was provided by (Leurent and Pivano, Ewgt 2018) for the “platform bottleneck” sub-model in CapTA’s line model. In a similar spirit, this paper brings about a formal sensitivity analysis of the “track occupancy” and “vehicle loading“ sub-models. The track occupancy model deals with the occupancy requirements from dwell times and also safety margins between trains, in relation to service frequency: excess requirements induce a bottleneck for train traffic passing by the track element, thereby reducing the frequency downstream that place, while delaying subsequent trains upstream. The sensitivities of occupation requirements, frequency reduction and upstream delays to the dwell time, safety and base frequency are modeled and computed in a systematic way. The “vehicle loading” model deals with passenger flows in and out of the vehicle and especially its seats: access to seats is demanded at each station first by standing riders then by incoming ones, while sitting riders release their seats on alighting. The comfort states either sitting or standing determine the generalized cost by origin-destination pair: the mean and variance are evaluated in the model. Their sensitivities to the O-D flow matrix, to seat capacity, to node and link trip times and also to comfort parameters are modeled and computed in a systematic way. A numerical instance of train traffic on line RER A in Paris is featured out. In the Regional Express Railway (RER) network, line A is the busiest line in France and maybe Europe, carrying more than 1 million trips every working day. Its timetable as of early 2017 scheduled 30 trains per hour at morning peak in the busier westwards direction. Yet track saturation frequently occurred at central station “Les Halles”, leading to an average 27 trains/hour effectively delivered and delays of about 8 minutes to riders. Application of sensitivity analysis enables us to assess the paradoxical value of reducing the scheduled frequency, since this alleviates the track saturation and lessens its consequences both on service operations and users’ trips.","Reminder. The sensitivity analysis of a simulation model with respect to a given input factor is purported to measure its specific impacts on the various model outcomes. Put in mathematical terms, it consists in computing the partial derivatives of the model outcomes with respect to the input factor: the resulting “sensitivity coefficients” can then be multiplied by a variation in the input factor to predict the amount of change in the outcomes. Sensitivity analysis can be performed in two ways, empirical versus theoretical. In the empirical way, the model is applied first to some base value for the factor of interest and then to a slightly different value, all other things kept equal: for every model outcome, the numerical difference between the two results, divided by the variation in the input, amounts to the sensitivity coefficient. The theoretical way requires the simulation model to be endowed with a suitable analytical formulation: then, by formal calculus the model equations stating the outcomes can be differentiated with respect to the input factor and the resulting analytical formulae provide the targeted sensitivity coefficients.",MB,,,2018-10-31 09:48,0/0,,Nowy

","Exchanging information regarding traffic network related data, parties traditionally use a set of static references to the actual (road) network. Examples of such static references are used in TMC and DATEX II. These references use lists of road identifiers. The problem with this static road references approach is that the road network is continuously being changed which requires periodic administrative activity for all parties. Dynamic location referencing methods seek to reference locations without the requirement of a common definition of the road network. Examples of these methods are Agora-C, OpenLR, and Hidden Markov map matching. The challenge of these methods is that each party can have a network definition that deviates on the geographic location and on other descriptive information. Although the current OpenLR method takes into account possible deviations, it's decoding methods can still result in false positives. This paper shows how the OpenLR decoding method can be improved by using only a stepwise increased deviation range.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 09:54,0/0,,Nowy

","The improvement that the automotive industry revealed in the last few years with the introduction of ITS in their vehicles lead to the adoption of systems such as the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) and the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) that enable the truck platooning. Truck platooning is a group of trucks connected wireless that drive on sequence using automated driving technology and following the leader truck that have on-board the unique active driver of the entire platoon. The introduction of this technology allows advantages from several sides: (i) environmental and economic savings; (ii) safety; (iii) reduction traffic; and (iv) optimization of work/labor. In particular, this study aims at supporting policy makers in issues related to the freight transport sector providing recommendations based on quantitative analysis and comparison among: truck platooning and freight consolidation and providing possible scenarios of different levels of automation for the truck platooning (a driver on-board any trucks, a driver on-board only on the leader truck, the driverless scenario).

","Car sharing is a car rental system in which members have access to a fleet of cars on a time basis. Several different car sharing services have been developed by companies such as two-way and free-floating: the first one is characterized by a more rigid structure because of its station-based nature, the second one tends to be more flexible since a customer can pick up and drop off the car in any public parking inside a wide area (a special case of this is also the one-way car sharing system, where the return operation can be done on any other station). Being a member is the first step users have to take to use this sharing service. According to previous studies there is evidence that different car sharing systems attract different types of users (Becker and Ciari, 2015) and, on this purpose, authors took into account the membership analyzing explicitly the accessibility as a spatial attribute in a modal choice to estimate two-way car sharing potential in order to consider the availability of the system at a micro level (Juschten et al., 2017 and Ciari et al., 2015). The typical member profile for a two-way car sharing service has been analyzed by a survey using stated preferences data; the member tends to be young of age, to work in a professional field and to live alone or with one or more unrelated adults (Cervero and Tsai, 2004). Moreover, authors show how most of the current choice model analysis has been done comparing private modes (e.g. car) and car sharing services (Becker et al. 2017) considering the car availability as an exogenous attribute. Differently from past research, which dealt with analyzing the relation with demand characteristics, this study focuses on the analysis of supply attributes directly linked to territorial characteristics such as parking availability, parking cost, distance from city center, users’ trip chain in relation with location of activities and how they impact the membership choice. Furthermore, car ownership is also considered as an attribute and the endogenization of this variable is implemented in order to capture its influence on membership choice, otherwise the member can continue to be highly inclined to keep on using the privately owned car (Plevka and Tampѐre, 2015). A random utility function for two-way and free-floating car sharing is estimated using data from Berlin whereas Berlin case is validated by agent-based software Matsim. The paper captures how supply attributes are connected to membership choice considering this choice dependent on the supply system. Through a sensitivity analysis for both two-way and free- floating service, the study shows how membership is sensible to some of these attributes, identifying which supply characteristics make the difference in the user membership choice is an expected output. The model is used to compare the membership choice of free floating and two-way service with respect to the car mode showing how the demand is influenced by a given supply system and how that changes its long term-mobility decision.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 10:45,0/0,,Nowy

","Collecting single vehicle data helps controlling and understanding traffic systems. By integrating automated vehicles in road traffic, collecting data of human steered vehicles gets indispensable. This work describes an approach allowing automated vehicles to align with common road traffic in a safe and efficient way. The specific application is a T-intersection without traffic lights but high numbers of common vehicles. An automated vehicle is supposed to filter into the intersection’s major street while disturbing the ongoing traffic as little as possible. At the same time different requirements regarding the driving strategy of the automated vehicle have to be fulfilled. For this purpose, it is desirable to enable a fluent drive and to avoid stopping during the approach at all in regard to comfort and energy conditions. Utilisation of external sensors along the major street helps automated vehicles to choose a suitable gap among the ongoing traffic. Due to this, a prediction about the vehicle configuration on the major street is needed. A large set of externally collected traffic data allows a statistical analysis regarding patterns in human driving behaviour. When the current traffic situation on the major street is provided to the automated vehicle, a statistical analysis based algorithm can predict the best gap for filtering into the street. If the predicted situation is not matching to the real traffic configuration during the approach, a change in driving strategy takes place. Based on the updated prediction, the automated vehicle selects a speed adapting to the new situation. With regard to the described scenario we developed a stationary infrared sensor system including multiple measuring units to detect passing vehicles. The four sensors were attached to lamp posts next to a street with a distance of about 25 meters in between. From the generated data set a statistical analysis of temporal headway development is derived. We attached importance to a high accuracy, an easy installation of the sensor system and an easy processing of the generated data. Due to the low cost concept and the small dimensions of the system, rebuilding can easily be facilitated. During the measurement at a frequently used single lane road in Duisburg, Germany, several thousand cars were detected. A camera was used to verify the data in retrospective to ensure no other sources influencing the recorded signals. Afterwards the collected raw data is evaluated automatically by an algorithm with regard to receive the temporal headway development statistics. The public funded project “MEC-View” aims at collecting vehicle data from an urban major street with an infrastructure-based sensor system. Within this project we share our results to optimize the algorithms finding the most efficient driving strategy for the involved automated vehicle approaching the T-intersection.",,RK,TAK,"Practically valuable and methodologically sound approach.

","Technological advances in vehicle technologies, such as connectivity and driving automation, promise to open new possibilities for enhanced traffic management approaches with individual routing, scheduling and “slot-reservation” control schemes. Such novel approaches are intensively studying nowadays, but it is still not clear how to implement them in practice and to which degree they can actually improve the traffic network efficiency. In this study we are applying microscopic traffic simulation to assess the effectiveness of a traffic control logic that combines optimal routing and network-level time slot-reservation approach. Starting with comprehensive analysis of traffic management principles on network level, a novel relation between system-optimal routing (SO), optimal scheduling and traffic flow parameters is identified and presented. Results show that both SO routing and optimal distribution in time (by scheduling or departure time regulation) correspond to maximisation of simple metric of traffic flow multiplied by speed, known as “flow efficiency” or “power”. This metric is then used to to develop a specific framework and controller logic for network-level traffic management. Based on the mentioned approach a novel network loading algorithm is proposed. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed using microscopic traffic simulation applied on two case-studies: i) a 5-link Braess like toy network, and ii) a realistic urban network. In both cases, the assessment is carried out for different combinations of the model parameters in order to understand the generality of the results achieved. In all cases the traffic management approach is compared with the dynamic user equilibrium implemented in the traffic simulation package and with a network loading approach based on dynamically available information on the status of the network (which is the most likely evolution of the road transport system in the presence of connected and automated vehicles if proper traffic management is not put in place). Results clearly show that the proposed centralized traffic management approach is able to significantly improve the network performance. At the same time, we observe that the system optimum comes at the price of unequal conditions for different road users in a way that some of the road users be delayed unfairly longer than others. For this case we argue that the problem can be solved within an extended time horizon, i.e. the equality can be achieved, for example, within a week or longer, taking into account the existing user needs. In this light, results achieved open the way to future research steps in which more practical aspects of the network-level traffic management approach must be analysed.",,RK,TAK,"Interesting concept, though the SO centralized approaches are not only already introduced (please refer to exisitng research in the paper) and also criticized.

","We present a method for optimizing traffic signal settings, which can be used for both, offline planning and real-time, adaptive traffic management. The method is based on metaheuristics efficiently searching space of possible settings and evaluating candidate solutions using a microscopic traffic simulation or metamodels of simulations built using machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks, LightGBM). We present the results of extensive experiments and compare different algorithms and their configurations in order to find the best approach in our use case. Experiments were carried out on a realistic road network of Warsaw (maps originated from the OpenStreetMap service) using dataset generated by the Traffic Simulation Framework tool. They showed that LightGBM may outperform neural network in terms of accuracy of approximations, time efficiency and optimality of traffic signal settings, which is a totally new and important result. Later, neural networks and LightGBM-based models were used to evaluate the quality of traffic signal settings (represented as vectors of offsets) in the traffic optimization task (so-called, Traffic Signal Setting problem). We tested several optimization algorithms (e.g., simulated annealing, gradient optimization, tabu search, particle swarm optimization, Bayesian optimization) and showed that genetic algorithms (GA) give the best results (in comparison to other metaheuristics). In the paper, we describe the goal and motivation of our research, settings of experiments, discuss their results and implications and present ideas for future research, focusing more on optimization algorithms which gave us best results: genetic algorithms and gradient optimization.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 11:25,0/0,,Nowy

","Keywords: V2V-Communication, V2X-Communication, Connected Vehicle, Distributed Computing Platform, Big Data Infrastructure, Radio Channel Modelling The accelerating change towards an increasingly networked and highly automated individual and public mobility is determined by numerous boundary conditions and new technological possibilities. These include, for example, robust object recognition, enriched map material, high-precision localization options, but also stable communication capabilities. The robust collection, processing, provision and utilization of communication data thus becomes a key enabler for the generation of future mobile services. This paper describes the development of a service platform for basic services of networked driving. It first examines the vehicle infrastructure with local computing units, 802.11p communication modules and integrated antenna modules. This vehicle infrastructure is installed in vehicles with different types of use. On the one hand, two emergency vehicles operating exclusively in a convoy record bidirectional V2V communication data (e.g. RSSI and PER). This takes place all year round as well as daytime and weather-independently within and around a large German city with approx. half a million inhabitants. On the other hand, additional vehicles are integrated into the system architecture, which collect V2V and V2X communication data in specific driving scenarios. In a first prototype, approx. 3.6 million data lines of geographically referenced communication data have already been evaluated. Using reverse geocoding, for example, a V2V network coverage map was created for the urban area. The representation of the vehicle infrastructure is followed by explanations of the Big Data infrastructure. In the now expanded system architecture, data acquired on the vehicle side is not stored onboard and transferred to a two-layer Big Data infrastructure as was previously the case. For this purpose, we use the open message protocol for machine-to-machine communication (M2M) MQTT. The first layer (""Speed Layer"") enables real-time data processing and display by sending a data set reduced to basic parameters via mobile radio. The complete data set within the second layer (""batch layer""), on the other hand, is first stored in a persistent buffer and only transferred to the big data infrastructure when a local network is available. A multi-server cluster with parallel streaming processors, which ultimately forward the incoming data to a distributed database management system, is used. In the further process, data obtained is approximated to a radio channel propagation model (here: IEEE 802.11p) by machine learning procedures. The modelling is based on several input parameters, e.g. distance and LoS/NLoS conditions between transmitter and receiver vehicle. If the same input features are later determined directly on the vehicle, a live prediction of the reception quality can be realized using the radio channel propagation model. Alternatively, the required model inputs can also be calculated on computing units outside the vehicle with a so called edge cloud functionality. Finally, the paper presents the usability of the service platform on the basis of concrete use cases.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 11:31,0/0,,Nowy

","Ride sharing offers great potential to decrease the number of vehicles in the street and improve traffic congestion, if the customers are willing to share a ride and accept a certain deviation from their direct travel route. The demand for ride sharing will probably increase with higher user convenience; however constraints on detour time, waiting time or even amount of time to board and disembark the vehicle, decrease the rate of shared trips. This tradeoff is important to be studied in order to find a balance that can be beneficial for both the customers, in terms of convenience, and the operators, in terms of offering shareable rides. To examine the potential to increase the number of shared trips in urban areas, the influence of both, urban and service quality parameters should be investigated. Tachet et al. (Scaling Law of Urban Ride Sharing) assessed the impact of urban parameters, such as velocity, operating area, delay time and trip frequency on shareability, a quantity that they define as the fraction of trips that can be shared. This study extends their research by evaluating also service quality factors in the estimation of shareability. The factors that are further investigated are: the time windows within which the customers can be picked up and the time the customer might need to board or disembark the vehicle. This paper will show how these factors affect shareability and how different demand levels of a ride sharing service influence the results. The additional impacts of service quality factors will be studied both by simulations and analytical considerations.",,RK,TAK,"Very interesting problem, hope to see literature backround and methodology in the full paper.",2018-10-31 11:37,0/0,,Nowy

","Pollution and congestion are important issues in urban mobility. These can potentially be solved by multimodal transport, such as the bicycle-transit combination, which benefits from the flexible aspect of the bicycle and the wider spatial range of public transport. Combined they compete with the car in a more sustainable and space-efficient way. In addition, the bicycle can increase the catchment areas of public transport stops. Most transit operators use a fixed 400m buffer as catchment area, although differences in catchment sizes have been observed for public transport stops of the same mode. Currently, not much is known about what influences the size of catchment areas, especially for the bicycle as a feeder mode. Research has implied that bicycles allow for reaching a further stop in order to avoid a transfer, but it is not clear whether travelers actually do this. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by assessing which factors affect feeder distance and feeder mode choice. Data are collected by a transit on-board revealed preference survey among tram travelers in The Hague, The Netherlands. These data are used to test a theoretical framework, containing four clusters of factors that may affect feeder distance and feeder mode choice. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression) are applied to test the hypothesized relations and quantify the impacts. In addition, a qualitative analysis explores the motives of the tram travelers to use a stop further away than the nearest stop and why they choose the bicycle as a feeder mode. Results show that the median walking feeder distance is 380m, and the median cycling feeder distance is 1025m. The tram stop density and chosen feeder mode are the most influential factors that affect feeder distance. For feeder mode choice, the following factors are found to be influential: tram stop density, availability of a bicycle, and frequency of cycling of the tram passenger. The qualitative analysis reveals that the motives of respondents for choosing a stop further away are mostly related to the quality of the transit service and comfort matters, of which avoiding a transfer is named most often. In contrast, the motives for cycling relate mostly to travel time reduction and the built environment. Three important barriers for the bicycle-tram combination have been discovered: unavailability of the bicycle, insufficient and unsafe bicycle parking places. Infrequent users of the bicycle-tram combination are more inclined to travel further to a stop that suits them better. The findings in this research can be used to (re)design transit networks by incorporating the found catchment sizes and removing the barriers for cycling. Furthermore, transport models can be optimized by incorporating the varying catchment areas. The qualitative analysis forms a valuable addition to the statistical tests and models: for scientific purposes it reveals influences that are not detected when using aggregate and objective data. For practice, the results of this study provide tools to improve the bicycle-transit combination.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 13:39,0/0,,Nowy

","Dynamic origin-destination (OD) matrix is a fundamental input for both offline (medium- to long-term planning and design) and online (real-time management, ITS) transport applications. Starting from an existing (a-priori) demand estimation, the problem aims at searching for time-dependent OD demand matrices able to best fit the observed data and thus minimise the error between simulated OD flows and measured OD flows data. However, Marzano et al. (2008) demonstrated that this process is effective only when the ratio between the number of unknown variables (i.e. the OD flows) and the number of observations (i.e. observed link flows) is close to one. Since this ratio is usually greater than unity, the problem comes out underdetermined. In order to tackle this issue, researchers proposed different dimension reduction techniques, which we classify in “data driven” and “assumption based”. The former reduces the solution problem space by analysing the observed data structure (e.g. PCA) while the latter introduces a specific hypothesis on the evolution of OD flows across time. This work brings research on “assumption based” approaches one-step further. Specifically, the main objective of this paper is to provide a cross comparison between two methods: the GLS-based quasi-dynamic estimator (QD-GLS) and Two-step (TS) approach. The QD-GLS estimator works in the within-day dynamic context under the quasi-dynamic assumption, according to which OD shares are constant across a reference period, whilst total flows leaving each origin vary for each sub-period within the reference period. Following the same assumption, the TS approach separates the dynamic demand estimation problem into two sequential optimizations. The first step uses a strict quasi-dynamic assumption (i.e. all OD shares are constant over time) to correct the total flow generated for each traffic zone while the second adjusts distribution values running a traditional optimisation procedure. By comparing the two methods, authors can provide an exhaustive assessment of the quasi-dynamic assumption evaluating in which context both models can gain the best performances, not only in terms of variance of the solution, but also in terms of necessary inputs to implement both formulations. The main difference is that, while the QD-GLS leverages an analytical approximation of the objective function to update the demand flows, the TS uses simulation based approaches, such as the SPSA. This means that the TS is more flexible as it does not require knowing the assignment matrix to update the OD-flows. However, this comes with a significant computational cost. Investigating on this purpose is crucial, as both methods reported satisfactory results in terms of reducing the solution space size and performed better estimates when compared with traditional estimators in terms of both variance of the solution and optimization efficiency. Validation of the quasi-dynamic assumption will be developed by means of extensively testing both estimator performances both on congested and uncongested networks. Results will be presented in terms of estimation accuracy (different starting matrix, different formulations of the objective function) reliability and computational performances.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 13:41,0/0,,Nowy

","Collision avoidance systems (CAS) have greatly increased in automotive market since they have proven to be effective in reducing head-on crashes. An interesting application of these system has been used in pedestrian safety by means of automatic braking systems. The key operating parameter for these advanced emergency braking system is based on the Time-To-Collision (TTC) concept that, in turn, it is strongly affected by the actuated overall mean deceleration that on dry pavement surface is about 8 to 10 m/s2. However, since the corresponding stopping distance is mainly influenced by tire-road friction level, on wet pavement surfaces much lower deceleration values can be reached thus implying a dramatic recalibration of decision rules governing the operating conditions of the system. In this paper a methodology to evaluate the mean deceleration useful to estimate optimal TTC values on wet pavement surface is presented as far as an advanced emergency braking system designed to reduce the risk in pedestrian vehicle crashes is concerned. By making use of a correlation model between pavement surface characteristics and tire performance, this latter expressed by means of a conventional tire labeling value, according to current EU legislations, stopping distance and corresponding mean deceleration value can be derived on a stochastic basis. An example application is finally presented to illustrate the methodology developed.",,MK,,,2018-10-31 13:49,0/0,,Nowy

","Pedestrian safety is a primary requirement in the configuration of urban areas and it is particularly relevant for public gathering spaces, such as railway and underground stations, airports, stadiums or shopping malls. Besides, in modern societies, the quality and the comfort level of the available walking environments play a key role in the challenge of sustainable mobility. For these reasons, over the last twenty years, there has been a growing interest in developing methodologies and tools for modelling and analysing the walking transport mode. In this context research lines include: the definition of mobility performance indicators or planning guidelines; the development of video-tracking and anomaly detection systems; and the implementation of simulation models at different scales. The overall aim of our work is to contribute in investigating the collective phenomena and emerging properties that can be crucial in the realistic characterization of pedestrian dynamics. Firstly, we propose an agent-based model that is able to simulate the interactions between individuals and the environment. Following a microscopic approach, individuals are represented by computational entities (agents) able to reach spatial goals avoiding collisions with other agents and obstacles. Each agent is characterized by several parameters, like the desired speed, the mass, the field of view, etc. An agent can make predictions, choose from a set of alternatives and autonomously decide to change its own walking behaviour. Inspired by “Social Force Models”, we define the variation in the desired speed of a pedestrian with a vectorial quantity that can be interpreted as a social force, and we encode the rules of the pedestrian's behaviour into an equation of motion. Eventually, we use this model to simulate pedestrian flows in a variety of conditions. To calibrate and validate our simulator, as well as to better understand the spatio-temporal evolution of pedestrian flows induced by different boundary conditions and constraints, we organised a set of experiments at the Engineering Department of “Roma Tre” University, in which a variable number of students has been involved. Several outflow states have been explored and reliable empirical data, such as density in specific areas and travel times, have been collected with a video recording system and advanced tracking software. The data allow validating the simulator both at the quantitative and qualitative level, as they are also able to capture the reactions of the involved people and the correct representation of the collective phenomena that arise from non-linear interactions among individuals. Furthermore, the experiments provide a way to assess how spatial configurations can influence the evolution of flow patterns and to identify some critical areas for the stream of people. For example, one can test the impact of obstacles along a path or of unexpected events, such as the blocking of an exit door. Our first results show a good agreement between simulations and the data obtained with the video-recording system, suggesting that this work can actually contribute in increasing the efficiency and safety of pedestrian flows dynamics.",,RK,,,2018-10-31 14:05,0/0,,Nowy

","The mobility sector is currently in a time of change. It underlies multiple trends, such as digital transformation, shared mobility, autonomous driving or vehicle electrification. In addition, the pressure on established mobility providers is raising, as more and more new players enter the market with conceivably disruptive potential. Therefore, many experts think that we are on the brink of the next mobility revolution. Especially the interconnection of formerly separated fields of industry brings many possibilities for new concepts and business models in the transportation sector. So to see in the example of UBER which perfectly combines the fields of telecommunication and transport, or food delivery services which connect drivers and restaurants seamlessly via smartphone. Even though there are many smart solutions a lot of potentials is left unused. Nowadays taxis spend a lot of time of its day waiting for customers. What if it could use this spare time driving and earning money, by transporting not only passengers but parcels, food or any other good that needs to be moved in the city? Most of the world’s taxis still drive on fossil fuels, but electric vehicles are gradually being introduced. Charging an electric vehicle is time-consuming. Furthermore, electricity prices will probably vary over time in the future. So what if the taxi optimizes its charging behavior based on transportation demand and variable energy prices? To investigate whether taxis could provide other services than passenger transport, a test network based on Mandl's Network was set up and a typical demand for passenger transport was randomly created for one day. The same procedure was applied for the variable energy prices. The first scenario investigates to which extent taxis can transport parcels in addition to passengers and simultaneously optimize their charging behavior. Parcels are collected at a fixed point in the network (post office) and are distributed to randomly chosen destinations. Thereby, the only constraint is that as many parcels as possible are delivered over the day. Passenger demand (origin and destination) occurs randomly at all nodes in the network. The charging facilities are located at one fixed node in the network. A restriction was set that at the same time, there can only be one passenger or 5 parcels in a vehicle. For every time-step optimization algorithms decide, whether a passenger or parcels are collected and brought to their destinations. First results show that due to their high waiting times, taxis seem to be suitable to additionally transport parcels and to adapt their charging behavior to variable energy prices. Furthermore, the results show the times when the vehicles should charge and deliver parcels to optimize their daily outcome. As a next step, this information is used to define specific use cases for delivery and the smart energy grid. Further scenarios will raise complexity by allowing to transport parcels and passengers at the same time, introducing vehicle models with different specifications and more realistic parcel delivery constraints. Finally, it is planned to verify the results with real-world taxi and delivery data from Munich.",,RK,TAK,Very interesting and innovative concept.

","The way of providing the end user with accurate data regarding the current road conditions is one of the very important components in the area of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In such cases one of the possibilities is to display the adaptive content on a dedicated road sign. The most important issue in the process of building the trust between the road signalling infrastructure and the end user is the information importance and its value. The ongoing NCBiR project - InZnak - aims to introduce a new type of the road signalling subsystem which relies on intelligent road signs equipped with variety of sensors and adaptive led displays. Sensors feed the autonomous algorithms with data necessary to take decisions how to react to current road conditions. The proposed system typically consists of a few road signs communicating with each other and exchanging measured data: weather conditions, road surface condition, traffic volume, avg. vehicle speed, detected road events, etc. The communication part takes advantage of wireless transmission techniques such as: LTE, LoRa and V2X. The broadband LTE connection is used in the direction from an interconnected group of intelligent road signs to the road management center. The LTE technology conveys data from each sensor, current status of each road sign, control commands and information to be displayed. The LoRa technology interconnects intelligent road signs and introduces long range communication in non-licensed EU863-870MHz frequency band to allow the data exchange process. And finally, the V2X (IEEE 802.11p) communication standard is used to send announcements and suggested speed limit from intelligent road sign directly to a passing car. The driver of the car could be then notified with the latest information related to the road section he is travelling through by his onboard infotainment system integrated with car's V2X receiver. On the basis of the information exchanged between road signs, each of them runs the autonomous algorithm to process that data and produces the current image of road section driving conditions. The InZnak project focuses on the problem of the traffic control using intelligent autonomous road signs. The process of the speed limit determination is often complicated and in many cases it is defined by numerous legal standards. In general speed determination should take into account not only the technical aspect, but also social and legal aspects which makes this process especially difficult. Nowadays, mostly speed limits are defined by experts taking into account qualitative and quantitative parameters of the considered roads. The proposed approach in the InZnak project is based on the determination of speed limits using the rule system. It enables determination of a variable speed limit on the basis of e.g. the weather conditions and properties of the road section - road class, road characteristics (e.g. the number of lanes, intersections, junctions, exits, entrances), the surface quality, and geometric parameters (the size of the arc, slope of the road). This paper presents the architecture of the INZNAK project road sign with the deployed prototype and its current status of integration.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 14:33,0/0,,Nowy

","The chain of activities performed by individuals and their spatial distribution are key elements in people’s mobility. Trip purpose influences mode choice and, in particular, the concept of tour (i.e. a chain of trips departing and ending at the same location) implies a strong correlation between decisions. Furthermore, the correlation’s complexity grows with the tour complexity and the set of activities. As a consequence, accounting for this phenomenon in mode choice models is fundamental to translate this connection at an aggregate level. We investigate here the correlation that can occur between the area where an individual chooses to perform activities (Activity Space) and its tendency to use either the car, public transport or soft modes. We assume that the Activity Space (AS) varies with the accessibility by road, public transport and parking of visited locations and thus has distinct features depending on the chosen mean of transportation. In addition, AS is highly correlated to the concept of Travel Time Budget, expected to be constant among different users. The main research hypothesis behind this work is that mode choice and travel time directly correlate to the dimension of the AS. In this work, the methodology employs detailed data analysis of users’ behavior based on a travel survey collected on 43 employees of the university of Luxembourg for two weeks, in two consecutive years: before and after their workplace relocation. Different “users’ type” are identified based on their travelling habits and together with this clustering analysis, we define their AS. The computation of these areas can be applied to various kind of dataset once they contain a set of visited locations during a certain period. The used methodology, already applied to the same dataset, is the “Standard Deviational Ellipses” (SDE). This methodology is “frequency-weighted”, meaning that the number of visits to a specific place is considered and so the described area is strongly defined by the home and work location. These two sites are therefore often anchor points of the AS. However, the dispersal of activities depends on the connection among them and can be related to the characteristics of a given SDE such as width, length or surface. The two waves of multi-day travel survey give a significant characterization of different types of users. The number of respondents offers a strong representation of public transport users, that gives a good opportunity for observing intrinsic characteristics related to these modes of transport, even though the global size of the sample prevents from a solid generalization. Despite workplace relocation and a strong inertia on travel mode choice, some characteristics such as the average distance travelled remain specific and quite steady among modes. Combining these assumptions and findings in a standard mode choice model is the last step of this work that contributes to the state of the art by including topological information within the mode choice model. This aspect helps to relate mode choice to the complexity of activity chains, accounting for the impact at trip level of earlier or later activities.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 14:33,0/0,,Nowy

","In the last decade great advances have been achieved in the development of reliable Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. The feeling of safety in automated vehicles performing trajectory tracking in urban environments has become an interesting field of study, where several strategies have been proposed. However, most of the current approaches employ speed limiters for the longitudinal control of automated vehicles to avoid discomfort due to excessive lateral accelerations in paths with high curvatures. Therefore, the smoothness of the path must be evaluated previously in a planning stage before the trajectory tracking task. In this work, a comparative study is carried out with different comfortable predictive controllers based on kinematic model approaches. Moreover, the novelty of including the lateral acceleration as an additional state parameter into the tracking stage to avoid a previous speed limit calculation is evaluated. The control architecture for the automated driving problem is exhaustively explained. The strategies comparison is accomplished using a simulated test vehicle within a realistic environment developed in Dynacar. The low-level control disturbances are modeled trying to replicate the devices for a future real implementation of the vehicle motion control strategies. The performed tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches which automatically reduce the vehicle speed according with the increment of the lateral acceleration being unnecessary a speed planner. As the lateral acceleration is effectively constrained, higher speed limits are permitted in comparison with the typical approach, completing routes faster with a controlled level of comfort. The relevance of this work strives in the contribution of comfortable vehicle motion controllers and the advantage of constraining lateral accelerations in the control stage as an alternative for future implementation in real vehicles.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 14:52,0/0,,Nowy

","Efforts to analyze the causes of accidents and prevent traffic accidents have been continuously carried out. One of the ways to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to identify the hot spot area. In the spot-based traffic safety analysis procedure (i.e., network screening), the hot spot area can be selected from the pattern of traffic accidents based on the historical accident data along with roadway geographical information. Although this traditional screening analysis has been adopted well, in order to apply this method correctly, several conditions have to be met such as sufficient historical accident data on both timely and quantitatively. In this study, we have proposed a new framework to determine quantitative surrogate safety measures from both microscopic individual vehicle data and link level traffic information. A safety index was developed to analyze individual vehicle trajectory data collected through a DTG (Digital Tachograph) device installed in commercial vehicles such as a taxi, bus, or trucks. This index can measure the accident risk of individual vehicle in selected time level. The methodology of crash risk estimation of link level was also established by linkage analysis of individual vehicle crash risk calculated through the developed safety index with detector data. In addition, validation of link level crash risk is performed using historical accident data. The developed crash risk estimation methodology was applied to derive the crash risk ranking for the analysis section. Moreover, the network screening analysis using both the link level data and the individual vehicle data was performed. For easy linkage analysis among various datasets, the analysis section was selected as the Seoul Ring Expressway in Korea, which is the highway near the metropolitan area. The methodology proposed in this study is expected to be able to anticipate and cope with a high probability of occurrence of a traffic accident. In the future, we can use the network screening technique to derive the crash risk ranking and suggest the hot spot in terms of traffic safety in the crash risk map. Crash risk map is expected to provide proactive and predictive customized traffic safety information for traffic accident prevention. In addition, it is expected to be able to derive the proactive safety management based on crash risk prediction by calculating the desired link speed using the crash risk analysis result as input data.",,MK,,,2018-10-31 15:33,0/0,,Nowy

","The current assessment of the impact of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) services on the level of traffic safety and efficiency is based mainly on expert assessments, statistical surveys or several traffic safety models requiring development. There is no structured, uniform assessment method that would give the opportunity to compare the impact of ITS services and their different configurations. In the case of simulation studies, there is no analysis of the impact of ITS service implementation on motorways or expressways on the surrounding road network. The approach presented in the article takes into account the impact of ITS services implementation on alternative routes. The paper presents the methodology for researching the effectiveness of ITS service – ramp metering implementation using transport models and key indicators allowing such an assessment. An approach was used in which the impact of ITS services is analysed using macro, meso and microscopic models. Macro and mesoscopic models allow estimation of the impact of ITS services on the efficiency of transport network operation and constitute the basis of analyses at the microscopic level, which takes into account the behaviour of drivers through the use of car following and lane change models. As part of the analyses, road network test models (for motorways and expressways along with an alternative route) were developed. Test models include road class, network topology, and different traffic intensity. The models were calibrated using real data (data from the traffic measurement station, data measured in the field, traffic distribution data from the VIATOLL charging system) and data from the vehicle simulator. On the basis of research, key indicators of road network efficiency were identified for ITS services that were analysed using road network test models (travel time, travelled distance, delays, number of stops, queues, average speed) as well as traffic safety indicators (surrogate safety measures were applied). In order to verify the results, models of real road systems for motorways and expressways, including real data from the control group, were developed. The obtained results allowed to develop a model using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, which will enable the road manager to choose optimal ITS solutions and make a decision on the appropriateness of implementing ITS service on the planned or existing motorways and expressways.",,MK,,,2018-10-31 15:49,0/0,,Nowy

","It is commonly accepted that bicycle is one of the most sustainable modes of transport within urban areas and due to that fact, many efforts are being made, at an international level, to promote it. Bike-Sharing Systems can contribute significantly to the achievement of cycling promotion and therefore more and more cities are introducing such systems. However, not all bike-sharing systems are equally successful. One of the most important parameters for their success, which has not been explored to a large extent, is the proper utilization of technology to support them. A number of ICT solutions have been developed to serve bike-sharing systems management and operation, and each successful system has its own official application to support its users. The research question in this paper is whether a mobile application that provides several advanced services to a bike-sharing system users, such as online top up, online rental process, optimum routing suggestions, record track, etc., could help increase the level of the system’s use. To answer the aforementioned question, a questionnaire survey has taken place in Thessaloniki, Greece addressed to both existing users of the bike-sharing system operating in the city as well as to the other residents of the city who are potential users of the system. Through the questionnaire the respondents were asked to identify what services they consider useful to be provided by an application, in the form of a five-level Likert scale. Respondents were also asked to state if a mobile application that would provide such services would motivate them to use the system more often (for existing users) or to become members of the system (for potential users). In order to analyze the responses, two decision trees have been developed (one for each category of users) to classify users based on the likelihood of shifting to or using more the bike-sharing system. This type of analysis can provide useful insight to bike-sharing systems’ planners and operators as it helps them to more accurately identify their target group and develop a suitable strategy to attract and engage them in the system.",,RK,TAK,Interesting cross-disciplinary approach and problem.

","Graph-based analysis has proven to be a good approach to study topological vulnerabilities of road networks through specific metrics, such as betweenness centrality. Node (or edge) betweenness centrality is a very popular network metric that allows characterizing nodes (or, respectively, edges) that are most traversed by shortest paths connecting pairs of other nodes of a graph. In its unweighted, undirected classical definition, betweenness centrality has been widely adopted in transportation studies to identify critical road segments and intersections that could represent vulnerable infrastructural spots, given the very high number of potentially highly-traversed paths flowing through them. However, congestion and vulnerability do not only depend on the topological features of the transport network, but they are strongly induced by static and dynamic context factors, such as road capacity, speed limits, travellers' behaviors, accidents, social gatherings and maintenance operations. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study on how betweenness centrality, computed on directed, dynamic and weighted graphs, can be able to capture and anticipate traffic dynamics. To generate graph weights, we consider a preliminary analysis leveraging static features only, such as road length, free-flow travel time, road capacity. Such static information is derived from the real road network of the agglomeration of Lyon, France. Then, in a first dynamic and more realistic analysis, we derive and use edge weights from synthetic traffic generated via a simulator. Dynamic edge weights are computed via traditional traffic metrics, such as mean travel-time, mean speed, and vehicle flow. Finally, in a second dynamic analysis, we confirm our results on real dataset, by extracting dynamic graph weights from Global Positioning Systems (GPS) floating taxi trajectories and vehicle counts from loop detectors installed in the agglomeration of Lyon. In all our dynamic evaluations, we consider dynamic traffic metrics as well as travel demand to compute betweenness centrality for different time slots. The results prove the existence of relevant spatio-temporal correlations of betweenness centrality with traffic metrics. Such correlations justify the usage of dynamic, weighted graph-based modelling and betweenness centrality for the implementation of next-generation proactive, data-driven urban monitoring systems. These systems are expected to empower urban planners and traffic operators with novel intelligent solutions to reduce traffic congestion and vulnerability risk, therefore contributing to implement the vision of a more resilient and sustainable city.","Keywords: Betweenness Centrality, Weighted Graphs, Traffic Monitoring, Correlation Analysis, Transportation Networks",RK,TAK,"Interesting theoretical graph-based approach.

","Vehicle bunching often occurs in high-frequency transit systems leading to deterioration of service reliability. It is thus necessary to control vehicles during operation. Holding control is a common solution for this situation. Nevertheless, it may result in longer vehicle running times. Speed adjustments can potentially contribute to more regular operations while preventing prolonged trip times. The impact of combining these two strategies is hitherto unknown. The objective of this study is to assess the impacts of a combined control strategy for a regularity-based operation. In the general concept of the integrated speed adjustment-holding strategy, there are two control decision triggers: upon entering a road segment (link) and upon entering a stop (node). In the proposed concept, speed adjustment becomes the primary measure for maintaining the regularity. In the case where slowing down an early vehicle is required, and speed adjustment has reached its minimum speed boundary, holding control acts as an additional control strategy at the control point stop. Conversely, a late vehicle may speed up as long as the maximum speed boundary is not exceeded. For the purpose of evaluation, the regularity performance obtained by the proposed strategy was compared with the results from implementing each control strategy in isolation, using a dynamic public transport operation and assignment simulation model (BusMezzo). A case study of AllGo bus operation in Almere, the Netherlands, was considered in the evaluation, using AVL and smartcard data. The findings showed that in seven out of eight cases, the speed adjustment-holding control yielded 18-63% improvement in term of regularity, compared to holding control only. Meanwhile, compared to the speed adjustment only, the effect of having a combined control proved to be smaller, with a regularity improvement ranging between 0-15% in five out of eight cases. However, it was found that under some conditions, the proposed strategy obtained a longer trip time by resorting to both holding and slowing down. The performance obtained by each strategy is highly influenced by line characteristics. The headway-based holding control is affected by the control point locations. For speed adjustment-holding and speed adjustment, three aspects affect its performance: the arrival time prediction, speed range and demand pattern. Both strategies are most sensitive to the arrival time prediction. In general, the proposed control strategy, as well as speed adjustment, need to be studied further to investigate its performance under a large range of conditions prior to field implementation. In contrast, holding control strategy performs well under different conditions without many requirements. For implementation, these characteristics provide the indications to a preferable control strategy.",,RK,TAK,"Very interesting and significant problem.

","Historically, computer systems process information and as such, information security risks have been addressed mainly on confidentiality issues (protecting information from theft). Lately, with autonomous vehicles driving themselves for thousands of miles, the developed systems are constantly interacting with the physical world. Thus, the failure of the security controls of these vehicles could cause a danger to public safety and shake public confidence in the technology. This imposes the need to focus more on integrity of these system (protecting sensor input data and actuator output commands from tampering), as the ability to assess the security of autonomous vehicle systems and provide assurances that they are safe to operate is critical for their implementation to be successful and accepted. This work presents the first risk assessment of an autonomous vehicle and provides a quantitative method to evaluate the potential risks; allowing the selection of the appropriate security controls for a system. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) risk assessment process is adapted in order to allow for the use of quantitative methods instead of qualitative methods and an optimisation algorithm for prioritising security controls for an autonomous vehicle system is proposed. The starting point for our analysis is the estimation of the risks associated with cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles. We perform an in-depth exploration of the sources of vulnerabilities for autonomous vehicles, and determine the likelihood of occurrence based on available historical values for similar events (e.g. Attacker gains access to computer via outdated software). Given the characteristics of the vulnerabilities we use Poisson distributions to define likelihood. A similar analysis is followed for the impacts that cybersecurity threats might have to autonomous vehicles operations. Based on the results of the likelihood and impact assessment, stochastic risk values are calculated from random sampling of their distributions. Using the stochastic risk values, a Monte Carlo simulation samples values of the residual risk. The result of a stochastic calculation is a probability density function of annualised expected loss where the annualised expected loss is the summation of all residual risks to the autonomous vehicle system. Based on the estimated risk, we introduce, evaluate and optimally select a set of controllers that could protect an autonomous vehicle system, based on their effectiveness. The results of our analysis cater for an interesting discussion with regards to the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure adequate operations of autonomous vehicles as they can cause accidents and create disturbances to the transportation system.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 16:51,0/0,,Nowy

","According to recent demographic reports, most big cities around the world become denser and wider, and due to the lack of space for building new infrastructure, the problem of urban traffic management is steadily gaining momentum. During the peak hours, arterial traffic networks face serious congestion problems, and the performance of infrastructure degrades significantly. Many efforts have been carried out regarding the real-time optimization of traffic signal settings. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice strategies cannot deal efficiently with oversaturated conditions (i.e. queue spillbacks and partial gridlocks). This is because either they are based on application-specific heuristics or they fail to accurately replicate the propagation of congestion. In the current work, we study the problem of real-time urban traffic control in two management layers. Essentially, our approach aims at classifying signalized intersections into three clusters; namely, critical, intermediate, and undersaturated intersections. This clustering is achieved by formulating and solving a static optimization problem that is based on historical data and considers two criteria: (a) the level of congestion, and (b) the homogeneity of traffic conditions in every intersection. The more congestion and less homogeneity an urban mode exhibits over time, the higher the probability to be deemed critical. The objective function takes into account these two criteria in order to classify each intersection in one of the aforementioned three clusters. In the first traffic management layer, max-pressure control is applied in the different clusters. Max-pressure is a recently proposed distributed control scheme for urban signal control. The first objective of the study is to investigate the performance of the network for different penetration rates of intersections that run max-pressure in real-time. In the second traffic management layer, we apply perimeter control to the inter-transferring flows between urban zones. The integrated two-layer hierarchical framework combines perimeter and max-pressure control and tries to identify a small number of critical intersections in the network that can improve the total throughput of the transport system. A traffic microsimulation tool is used in order to assess the impact of each scenario to the overall traffic conditions. An urban network is simulated with a realistic OD matrix and we investigate the different penetration rates of controlled nodes (i.e. clusters), and compare the simulation outputs to the results we get with the default signal settings that are currently used in the field. Preliminary results demonstrate that a smart selection of (critical) intersections together with a network-level perimeter controller can significantly improve the system performance and reduce the operational cost. Instead of controlling all the network intersections in real-time, just by identifying the critical ones, and also regulate the flows in the perimeter of zones, can reduce the total delay, which has positive economic and environmental implications and provide better quality of service to the users of the infrastructure.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 17:38,0/0,,Nowy

","The current methods that aim at monitoring the structural health status of road pavements allow detecting surface defects and failures. This notwithstanding there is a lack in methods and systems that are able to identify concealed cracks (particularly, inter-layer cracks) and monitor their growth over time. For this reason, the objective of this study is to set up a supervised machine-learning-based method for the identification and classification of the structural health status of a pavement based on its vibro-acoustic signature. In particular, the vibro-acoustic responses of differently cracked road pavements to the vehicular traffic have been determined. These signatures were collected and analysed through a specifically designed Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN was designed to classify the different level of damage of the pavements under test. Different configurations of the ANN were tested and compared in order to define the most performing one. Results show the possibility of associating a specific vibro-acoustic signature to a road pavement through the most efficient ANN. These results are encouraging and represent the bases for the application of the proposed method in real contexts (smart cities) by mean of suitable and well-designed tools for ITS.

","Road safety research aims at improving traffic safety, typically by analyzing accident causes and suggesting suitable measures for improvement. The main source of information is road accident reports to the local authorities. Information on accidents is recorded with differing granularity. In Germany, a report of the accident is written by the officer first present at the accident location. Additionally, for the storage in an accident database, there are pre-defined categories for accident types, causes, participants, severity, etc. which the accident can be classified into for later analysis and the usage in statistical reports. This classification is a time-consuming task for the authorities in charge is therefore not done for all accidents. Accidents which do not involve personal or major material damage, are usually not categorized. In addition, as the categorization is done manually, it involves the risk of mistakes. The analysis of all kinds of minor accidents and conflicts, though, is of major interest, for example in the development of automated driving functions which shall address these conflicts, for infrastructure planners aiming at improving the street layouts or for insurance companies trying to understand minor but costly material damages on the vehicles. Due to the large effort needed to analyze text data, the analysis of minor accidents is usually neglected. This paper uses the records of accidents from three arterials in Munich, Germany and addresses the difference in accident analysis when a) only categorized major accidents are considered and b) also minor accidents are analyzed. Text mining methods are presented and used to analyze the accident descriptions. Accident data from three arterials from the city of Munich, Germany was provided by the local police department for a time period of five years between 2013 and 2017. All accidents on either of these streets which were reported to the police during that time sum up to 4,582 accidents. All major accidents, which include personal or material damage, are classified into pre-defined categories, which results in a total of 1,607 categorized accidents which means that only 35% of the accidents are usually used for further statistical analysis. The classifications reveal that most accidents are with other road users driving in the same longitudinal direction. An even higher share is classified into the category ‘other’, which mainly belong to the class of accidents that happen during parking maneuvers. The most severe accidents with fatalities happen between vehicles and pedestrians when these cross the street. With the help of text mining methods, the short descriptions of the accidents were analyzed and sorted into topics. Sample descriptions of categories of the accident types can serve as matching criteria for a clustering of the descriptions. Manual assignments give the ground truth to verify the grouping algorithms and can prove if the categorized accidents are statistically representative for all accidents. Additionally, topics which are not covered in the accidents categorizations can be revealed. These new insights into smaller accidents may help in the development of automated driving functions or for a safety-driven design of infrastructure.",,MK,,,2018-10-31 18:29,0/0,,Nowy

","Currently one of the main challenge of airports and airline companies relies on supporting passenger with updated, reliable and robust information on the whole trip, from the trip origin to the final destination. Information can have several aims: 1. to increase the users’ satisfaction (travel comfort) and travel experience, 2. to increase airport system (components) performances (check-in, security controls, etc….), 3. to manage airport system components, 4. to manage travel demand peaks, 5. to give commercial advices, 6. to optimize the time spent in the terminal. All the above information may allow to gain significant functional or commercial benefits. Within the introduced context, one of the main issues consists in understanding the potential passengers’ reaction to an Advanced Airport Passenger Information System (AAPIS). Moreover, it is also common opinion that traditional approaches used to interpret and model the users’ choice behaviour may lead to the neglect of the numerous non-quantitative factors that may affect users’ perceptions and behaviours. Indeed, psychological factors, such as attitudes, concerns and perceptions may play a significant role, which should be explicitly modelled. Such an issue is noteworthy, since the time and the cost to develop different modelling solution may be significantly different, may require different type of surveys, different knowledge background and different competencies. In this context, transportation planners and industry managers could be interested in identifying the most effective modelling solution to interpret and forecast travellers’ behaviour. To this aim the present paper: (1) introduces and discusses main results from a specific survey aimed to investigating air passenger’ behaviour in the presence of AAPIS, (2) models passengers’ behaviour through consolidated discrete choice model, (3) investigates the potentiality of Hybrid Choice models (latent variable) to interpret passengers’ reaction/compliance to/with AAPIS. In particular, the three typical airport passengers travel activities were investigated: check-in, security checks, gate-in. For each of them, a specific information system providing the waiting time and suggesting alternative strategies was considered (e.g. to come back after a specific time interval).

The proposed models simulate the probability to be compliant or not compliant with the AAPIS. The originally of the paper is threefold: (1) the analysed phenomenon has not been yet investigated in literature (2) no existing, to the authors’ knowledge, has tried to model passengers' reaction to AAPIS (3) attitudinal factors have not been never investigated within the proposed experimental context.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 18:29,0/0,,Nowy

","Railway management systems, such as European reference ERTMS, deal with the safety of passengers, rolling stocks and infrastructure. Moreover, they aim at guaranteeing the efficiency of the offered service targeting optimized travel time and increased infrastructure capacity. Despite national distinctions, all the systems manage convoys circulation exchanging information about trains and railway infrastructure (e.g., monitoring data and command messages) by means of a hierarchical architecture where the intelligence is spread among different levels. In this vertical approach, lower levels are the higher populated ones, where monitoring devices and, in general, data generation nodes collect information and, eventually, execute local elaboration. Then the information is dispatched to the intermediate nodes (Peripheral Points), where further elaboration may be required for local management actions. Finally, at the higher levels, Central Points generate command messages for trackside actuators and traveling convoys using the combined data. In this context, the progressive introduction of softwarization of services can pave the way toward highly flexible and reconfigurable next generation railway systems. This paper discusses the adoption of SDN/NFV (Software Defined Networks/Networks Function Virtualization) framework in railway control networks drawing possible key directions of research. Furthermore, in order to better understand the disruptive potential of the SDN/NFV framework adoption on diverse components of the railway management system alleviating the local computational load, allowing further elaboration suitable for proactive and dynamic management actions and increasing system reliability and efficiency, two use cases suitable for railway systems are targeted: NFV-driven edge computing and SDN reliability. In the former use case, configurable orchestration systems are proposed aiming to dynamically instantiate required services on Virtual Machines (VMs) directly in the peripheral places by means of edge computing solutions substituting trackside and on-board devices manual configuration, with the aim of reducing the latency, improving local system responsivity and security. In particular, the instantiation of a VM or a container at each peripheral place deploying a firewall VNF to control the access to the local equipment allows a secure authentication of authorized technicians on local board reachable by an Orchestrator. The Orchestrator instantiates a VM with a dedicated desktop including all the authorized settings on the remotely configurable devices, accordingly to a Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) paradigm, with strict security guarantees for the infrastructure operator, by spawning preconfigured VMs according to the VNF services needed. Furthermore, the introduction of a centralized control software can drastically simplify the railway system management, enabling improved maintenance procedures and cost savings, while guaranteeing a high security level. In the latter use case, an improved failure recovery mechanism suitable to increase the network reliability of railway control and management networks is proposed. Experimental results show that disrupted traffic flows are recovered in less than 100 milliseconds. Moreover, with respect to traditional approaches that typically work on ring topologies, the proposed SDN solution can be easily extended to complex meshed topologies without degrading the recovery time and, in absence of network failures, it allows to route traffic along all the paths exploiting load balancing, thus achieving optimized utilization of the whole network.",,RK,,,2018-10-31 18:31,0/0,,Nowy

","Travel times and delays on freeways are highly dependent on the discharge rate of the bottlenecks. Consequently, it is important to model the traffic flow at bottlenecks as accurate as possible. However, this is not an easy task, especially at merge bottlenecks, where traffic is impacted by the acceleration, deceleration, and lane changing maneuvers induced by merging vehicles. The interaction of these factors results in a reduced discharge rate when the bottleneck is congested compared to the discharge rate observed when the bottleneck is uncongested. This phenomenon is often referred to as capacity-drop. Therefore, a traffic flow model of merge areas must also reproduce the capacity drop phenomenon features including: (i) magnitude of drop in the outflow, (ii) when and how the capacity drop occurs, and (iii) when the bottleneck can recover nominal capacity. This can be achieved by a model able to reproduce capacity-drop and the correct imputation of the parameters. Here we tackle the imputation of parameters aspect by proposing a calibration procedure that ensures the aforementioned aspects of capacity-drop are captured. The procedure, based on the Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE), does not require any information about the calibrated model and therefore is applicable to different models. The output contains multiple solutions in contrast to the usual single solution in single-objective optimization, which can be seen as multiple combinations of parameters that can reproduce the field measurements with the same level of accuracy. Unlike single-objective approach, defining weights is not necessary. This is beneficial even when the ultimate goal is to find a single solution. The practitioner can inspect the model outputs of each parameter set and pick the one that suits better. Also, the multiple solutions can be used for further analysis and applications such as parameter and output uncertainty. The procedure is tested against field data of a bottleneck in which capacity drop is consistently observed based on data of 16 days with 8 days being used for calibration and the rest for validation of the calibration results. The following implementations of link transmission model (LTM) are calibrated: (a) standard LTM with no extension (capacity-drop is not captured), (b) LTM with outflow reduction based on the upstream queue (density); (c) LTM with outflow reduction based on on-ramp flow, and (d) LTM with outflow reduction based on on-ramp flow and queue. In all cases the algorithm output approximate the Pareto Frontier or trade-off curve between downstream outflow and density errors. As expected, the errors are smaller as additional features are added to the model (from case (a) - no feature - to case (d) - two features) in both calibration and validation data sets. With the multiple solutions, time-dependent upper and lower bounds of density, outflow, and travel times can be obtained by applying the model for all solutions given expected demands. The results using data from the validation data set show the observed densities and outflows in the predicted range. Therefore a possible application is the estimation of lower and upper bounds of travel times.",,RK,,,2018-10-31 18:32,0/0,,Nowy

","This paper proposes a numerical assessment of the performance of the CoNL route choice model (Papola et al., 2018) in reproducing real observed choices. The CoNL is a particular specification of the CoRUM model (Papola, 2016). The main CoRUM assumption is that the random residuals cumulative distribution function is a linear combination of different random cumulative distribution functions. Such CoNL specification is obtained by combining Nested Logit cumulative distribution functions, with resulting closed-form choice probability and covariance statements. The application of the CoNL for route choice model is operationalised by means of an algorithm that, given any network, provides the model’s specification for each o-d pair and allows to implicitly compute its structural parameters. The CoNL route choice model has the advantage of taking into account the overlapping effects on the choice probabilities allowing to reproduce target Daganzo and Sheffi( 1977) correlations. Currently, its performance in terms of choice probabilities has been investigated only on some toy networks, by comparing the choice probabilities with reference to the Multinomial Probit (Hausman and Wise, 1978; Daganzo, 1979) choice probabilities, considered as a benchmark. Furthermore, the CoNL route choice specification is obtained on the Dial-efficient sub-network with reference to each origin o. Thus, the original paper compared only choice probabilities of efficient paths. The paper proposes a double operational advance: the possibility to take into account non-efficient paths in the CoNL specification and the numerical validation of the CoNL route choice model on real data. The comparison is based on a dataset of about 200 GPS trajectories on 149 different o-d pairs, detected with the aid of an Android application, named “Algoroute”. The trajectories have been collected by smartphone users travelling within the network of Regione Campania (Italy). The log-likelihood indicator is computed for the main route choice models available in literature (MNL, C-Logit, PS-Logit, Probit). The results show the superiority of the CoNL route choice model in reproducing observed choices.",,RK,TAK,"Methodologically very sound approach, illustrating important contribution in the RCM (CoNL, CoRUM).

","Relevance Disruptions in public transport can have major impact on passengers’ nominal and perceived journey time. In order to assess network vulnerability as well as measures aiming at improved network robustness, it is essential to integrate information on both the probability of a disruption occurring as well as its impacts on network performance once it occurs. The majority of scientific studies investigating the topic of public transport vulnerability focus on the impact of disruptions (e.g. Cats and Jenelius, 2015; Corman et al., 2010). In contrast, little is known on the frequency and location where different disruption types occur in a public transport network. Objective The objective of this study is to better understand and predict when and where on the metro network disruptions occur, thereby providing guidelines on where to prioritize measures aimed at reducing exposure to disruptions and its incorporation into economic assessment of the benefits of disruption mitigation. Methodology and case study Estimating the probabilistic properties of service disruptions requires a large dataset to ensure statistical soundness of relatively infrequent events. In this study we use a unique, recently provided dataset from WMATA, containing log-data of all disruptions which occurred on the Washington metro network for a 13-month period between August 1st, 2017 and September 1st, 2018. This provides us the opportunity to analyse long-term developments and trends regarding disruption type, frequency, location and duration. In the first phase, the disruption patterns from the Washington dataset are analysed. In our study we focus on disruptions in which at least 1 train is being blocked for more than 5 minutes. Based on the total of 1,981 disruptions remaining in the dataset, varying from relatively minor to major disruptions, we analyse the occurrence of disruptions over the different months of the day. We also investigate at which lines and metro stations most disruptions occur. Besides, an analysis is performed to the main causes of different disruptions, showing there is not 1 predominant cause as both technical issues (such as door malfunctioning, braking issues and track circuit failures), operational issues (operator errors or driver sickness) and passenger-related incidents form the top-10 causes. Based on the time the first train is blocked following a certain disruption, we investigate the duration of different types of incidents. In the second phase of the study, this data set is integrated with information from AFC and AVL systems regarding the number of trains, train-km, passengers and passenger-km at the different disruption locations. This allows for the development of a prediction model using regression models or a machine learning approach. Using input variables such as the number of train(km) and passenger(km), time of the day and year, rolling stock type etc. as independent variables, our goal is to improve the prediction how often, at which location, what type of disruption will occur. With this method, we generalize our insights from the Washington network to a generic prediction tool which is used to gain insights what parts of a metro network are most often exposed to disruptions typically.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 19:51,0/0,,Nowy

","Cycling is an increasingly popular mode of travel in cities due to the great advantages that it offers in terms of space consumption, health and environmental sustainability. Yet, the low perceived safety and riding comfort of cyclists is a hurdle to the desired uptake of cycling as an alternative to the car, with a particular deterrent being poorly maintained infrastructure, including road pavement defects, such fretting, ravelling, rutting and potholes. As a result, several city authorities worldwide are presently undertaking schemes aiming at improving cycling infrastructure. The present study focuses on Millbrook Road East, a 1 km long road stretch located on the Western edge of the city centre of Southampton. Recent opinion surveys with cyclists using it have identified that a series of pavement defects on the road surface affect the overall cycling experience, which was generally rated very poorly. This prompted the local authority to resurface the road, with works having been recently completed. But even though the perception of the cyclists continues to be analysed through surveys with cyclists post-completion of the works, establishing its relation with actual objective riding comfort measurements is challenging. The aim of this study is, hence, to investigate changes in riding comfort on Millbrook Road East before and after the resurfacing on the basis of objective measurements collected using the iBike instrumented bicycle. This is an advanced ITS research tool, equipped with an absolute encoder and off-the-shelf micro-electromechanical systems sensors (Hall Effect sensor, gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, temperature and pressure sensors), as well as with a GoPro camera, a GPS receiver (smartphone), and an Inertial Navigation System device. The data collection involves a number of volunteers having been tasked to ride the iBike on Millbrook Road East both before and after resurfacing, which has resulted in two large sets of mapped sensor data corresponding to a total of 20 runs for each of the before- and after-case. This is further complemented by relevant video footage using the on-board camera, enabling the linkage of certain data characteristics with specific pavement defects on the road. The analysis proceeds by initially filtering the data to eliminate noise and then deriving relevant metrics for characterising riding comfort from the measurements. Comparisons are drawn between the pre- and post-resurfacing data with respect to both individual locations/hot-spots and the road in its entirety. The analysis first produces riding comfort visual “heatmaps”, and then calculates the identified metrics. Statistical hypothesis tests are employed to confirm the validity of the effects identified, and regression modelling is used to derive patterns from the data with respect to how resurfacing works improve riding comfort. The findings show that there is overall less vibration and reduced swerving (to avoid defects) by cyclists in the after-case, as measured by the vertical and horizontal acceleration, which suggests better improved comfort. However, poor workmanship in some parts of the surface introduces new defects (e.g. around manholes) that are not visible to the naked eye, and these still have a negative effect on the riding experience.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 19:51,0/0,,Nowy

","An intensive work has been done by the scientific community in the last years to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of human behaviour through the development of disaggregate models, like Agent-Based Models (Balmer et al., 2006) and Activity Based Models (Bowman and Ben-Akiva, 2001; Bhat and Koppelman, 1999). Considering the difficulties of estimating travel demand in terms of individual behaviours, and the cost at which the required data are available, the proposed work emphasizes the need of directing transport research by chasing the opportunities that the development of technology has brought to. We believe that a more intense research effort is needed to better evaluate the difference between aggregate and disaggregate demand models. Disaggregate approaches require an immense volume of detailed data to provide realistic predictions, while aggregate approaches often provide a too coarse representation of the demand. The methodology presented in this paper offers a new perspective by providing an aggregate representation of the demand that still takes into account individual mobility on a daily basis. The goal of this paper is to bridge this fundamental gap by exploiting the wide range of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data freely available on the Internet. We propose to extend conventional aggregate demand models by introducing information about individual travel behaviour and trip-chaining concepts. Specifically, an aggregate demand model (a basic Gravity Model in this case) is used to reconstruct Origin-Destination demand flows for the home-work commute. This OD demand is adopted as a starting point to estimate tour of activities by assigning an activity pattern to each OD trip – which is assumed to represent an individual. Finally, temporal and spatial constraints derived from spatial geography are used to calculate the most likely distribution of secondary activities, benefiting from the contribution of geographic data to model demand flows that are consistent with individuals’ trip chaining behavior. The locations of these secondary activities (such as leisure) are based on a realistic network model and typological and topological characteristics of the network, retrieved through web-based services, such as Google and OpenStreetMap. A case study for Luxembourg City will be presented to show the potential of the methodology. Since the temporal distribution of the activities is estimated by using data from a different spatial context, the outputs of the model are validated through comparisons with official statistics. The results of simulating a workplace relocation show the advantages of this new approach: behaviours that conventional models were unable to capture are now significantly represented. Detaching the systematic demand from secondary activities and assigning the location of the latter ones in terms of spatial relations, permits to relocate secondary activities not only in the zones directly affected by the relocation, but in all the surroundings of home and work locations. The contribution of the geographic relations derived from GIS brings a significant methodological enhancement in the determination of mobility demand starting from simple gravitational principles. Future developments indicate how this methodology can overcome the need of travel surveys, making it close-to-universal, as well as open source.","References Balmer, M., Axhausen, K. W., & Nagel, K.

","Before fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) (e.g., Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 5) become prevalent on our roads, it is likely that we will see vehicles with increasing levels of autonomy entering the traffic stream. For example, vehicles with advanced driver assist features such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), which are SAE-Level 1 AVs, are becoming commonplace. Until recently, ACC was considered a premium feature and only available in a small number of vehicles. However, this is no longer the case, as more and more vehicles become available with ACC. For example, through the second quarter of 2018, 16 of the 20 best selling cars in the US were available with ACC. Adaptive cruise control is the first step toward fully autonomous vehicles, and while ACC has clear benefits from a driver comfort perspective, little is known about the impacts that ACC vehicles have on traffic stability. In this article a set of car following experiments are conducted to collect data from a common 2018 sedan equipped with a commercial adaptive cruise control system. Velocity, relative velocity, and spacing data collected during the experiments are used to calibrate an optimal-velocity relative-velocity car following model that includes a constant-time headway term. The string stability of the calibrated model is assessed, and it is determined that the system is string unstable under the tested settings and estimated model parameters. Modifications to the calibrated model are considered that render the model string stable in theory and in simulation. The main finding is that it is possible that modern, commercially-available ACC systems may be prone to causing phantom traffic jams, warranting further study of these systems to understand their potential impacts on traffic flow.",,RK,TAK,"Very practical and technical paper of high significance.

","Introduction. In recent years, transportation systems have seen new paradigms and fundamental technological advances, which represent the foundation for establishing intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we argue that due to the connected nature of these approaches, an integrated viewpoint on the design of ITS has therefore become appropriate. For this, we present a formal framework for integrated system design of ITS. State of the Art. Connected Mobility refers to an umbrella term for the potentially transformative patterns of future mobility in systems related to transportation, which is made possible by interconnection of everyday objects. Examples include disruptive paradigms such as ridesharing and mobility-on-demand, multi-modal passenger and freight transport optimization, as well as autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles, including their impacts on the power system. While engineering transportation systems has become more systematic with respect to engineering control strategies for emergent requirements arising from aforementioned paradigms, as of now, the current state of development has not addressed these complex requirements within systematic and holistic transportation system design methods. Problem Statement. These heterogeneous system requirements should not to be treated as confounding and emergent factors within designs of specific single systems only, which have to be controlled for at the operational stage, but instead should be considered in the design stage in terms of a sound holistic system understanding for the ITS already. Singular system designs, which only consider the objectives and constraints from single subsystems (e.g. either the transportation or the power system when considering electric vehicles) should be avoided as they neglect emergent interactions arising from systems with their neighboring systems. For this, however, a systematic understanding regarding viable design options for the ITS is necessary in order to avoid costly mistakes. Contribution. For this, we propose a formal system design abstraction, which allows for specification and evaluation of integrated transportation and power system designs. Design specification is supported by separation of concerns and decomposition, allowing the system engineer to focus on subproblems at a time. Here, firstly, static properties specific the static system makeup of a system design in terms of contained components and subsystem parameters, where parameters describe static information about components which does not change over the course of a single system design and based on dynamic behavior. Secondly, to enable dynamic subsystem design, we capture system behavior using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in terms of states, actions and transitions between states. Thirdly, requirements represent the design goals of the system under design. They are expressed as objectives and constraints with respect to a particular metric, which can be obtained from the system under design, i.e. parameters, components, states, actions and transition functions. Using this framework, we apply our system design abstraction for modeling multi-modal passenger and freight transport problems. We then evaluate the effectiveness of our system design abstraction (with given sets of components, parameters and requirements) using a small case study for a novel mobility-on-demand system.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 20:00,0/0,,Nowy

","Road safety is one of the most significant performance indicators inthe traffic networks. Currently, it is estimated that there are around 1.25 million casualties and between 20 and 50 million nonfatal injuries every year, globally. A potential change to these figures is expected because of the developments in the vehicle automation and connectivity. Automation technologies, from adaptive cruise control (ACC – automation level 1), to the fully automated vehicles with no restrictions on the Operation design domain (ODD – automation level 5) can provide significant opportunities to counter these trends.However, evaluating the risk involved in using these technologies is not a trivial task. One of the existing tools in traffic simulation are thesurrogate safety metrics (SSM), which can be a suitable mean forevaluating the level of safety of different technologies. Nevertheless, existing SSMs have been mostly developed for conventional vehicles and have important disadvantages of comparing their behavior to the behavior of automated vehicles (AVs) or connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Parameters such as the response time, the maximum and comfortable deceleration values, that can vary significantly between conventional vehicles and AVs are not considered in widely used metrics such as time to collision (TTC) or inverse time to collision (iTTC) indicators. According to the mathematical measure theory, any risk measure must satisfy a number of criteria, one of which, is to satisfy countable additivity, that most existing SSMs fail to satisfy. Moreover, many SSMs are discontinuous and the results can be crisp, classifying safe or unsafe situations, based on thresholds that are hard to properly calibrate, without providing information about the probability or the severity of an accident. A distinction can be made between SSMs, dividing them in active or passive safety metrics. Active safety metrics such as TTC identify situations where there is an imminent danger and responses are necessary. Passive metrics such asDSS(Difference between Space distance and Stopping distance) or PICUD (Potential Index for Collision with Urgent Deceleration) identify unsafe situations where evasive action may not be immediately necessary. Proper evaluation of the safety level of a trajectory or a controller, requires information for both active and passive safety metrics. In this light, two new SSMs, based on fuzzy logic have been developed, the fuzzy passive safety metric (FPSM)and the fuzzy active safety metric (FASM). There is great variability in traffic networks and apart from extreme boundaries in the safety range scale there are situations that according to the perspective can be considered safe only to a certain degree. Here is where Fuzzy logic can give us valuable insights on the topic and help us design better indicators. Results of this work show that FPSM and FASM are robust indicators in classifying a situation to be totally safe, very unsafe or even a little risky, corresponding to the spectrum of different behaviors. The novel fuzzy safety metrics are tested on synthetic trajectory data, to showcase their advantages on evaluating the safety level of longitudinal movement.",,MK,,,2018-10-31 20:07,0/0,,Nowy

","The future of urban transport environments is being reshaped by the potential introduction of autonomous vehicles within their networks. The development of such vehicles is implemented within closed and controlled testbeds that simulate the urban environment. Such testbeds assume that laws should regulate how traffic operates. Another assumption is that autonomous vehicles by design (through their coding) follow the existing regulations and act accordingly. However, there exist societies in which unlawful behavior has become the norm for most of its drivers. In such an environment, the traffic and infrastructure conditions themselves compel drivers to adapt to the current conditions and disregarding the law in an effort to travel to their destination in an efficient -and safe- manner. A potential unlawful behavior planning of autonomous vehicles has three major requirements, namely that any such decisions are: a) technically possible b) legally defensible, and c) ethically justifiable. The technical capabilities of autonomous vehicles in making complex decisions have already been studied to some extent. To this end, the purpose of this paper is twofold. Initially, through the relevant literature review, it is called to explore whether the concept of an autonomous vehicle acting beyond established laws is defensible. Moreover, in an effort to explore the ethical justification of such behavior, this paper aims to answer two important questions. Firstly, it ascertains how drivers behave under shifting and unlawful conditions. Furthermore, it assesses whether the potential passengers of autonomous vehicles expect the vehicle to act in a manner similar to that with which they themselves would drive. These two questions form the basis of a questionnaire that is distributed amongst drivers of the Greek urban transport environment. This questionnaire identifies conditions under which Greek drivers would disregard the law and to what extent. Finally, the questionnaire juxtaposes these findings with the expectations of the aforementioned drivers from autonomous vehicles.",,RK,TAK,"Conceptually very interesting and up-to-date approach.

","Electrifying road transport is seen as one of the key components in decreasing the carbon footprint of the society as a whole. Recent developments in electric drive-train and battery technology have helped to develop cars – and soon also trucks - with ranges that make them independent of public charging infrastructure during most sub-urban and commuting trips. Once long-haul trips are planned, however, these vehicles require a dense network of charging infrastructure. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the impact of a wide electrification of vehicles in long-distance trips by combining two components into a transport simulation model: Firstly, a model of long-distance travel and travelers’ behavior for both passengers and freight is created based on several different available sources which include existing national models and various openly available data sources, such as OpenStreetMaps. The model depicts travel and congestion patterns for the whole of Sweden at a person- and vehicle-sharp level in a multi-modal way. Secondly, a detailed model of energy consumption and battery charging is integrated. For the energy consumption of vehicles, several vehicle types with different consumption and characteristics and battery capacities are defined for both passenger cars and trucks. These depict the typical vehicle fleet in Sweden. Vehicle charging is simulated with different charging infrastructure and charging speeds for both trucks and cars. The whole model is run using MATSim, a well-established software for agent-based transport modeling. As an open source software, MATSim is easily extensible. In a first case-study for the model, all vehicles, irrespective if passenger car or truck, are electrified. This means, that agents in the simulation need to schedule charging if their trip exceeds the range of their battery. Preliminarily, locations of currently existing manned gas stations are used for re-charging vehicles using fast charging infrastructure. At this time, simulation results are still preliminary. However, first indications show, that the daily estimate for energy consumption is in the region of 150 GWh. This equals roughly one third of the current Swedish electricity consumption. Energy consumption is the highest along in the motorway network connecting the south of the country (Malmö, Göteborg and Stockholm). Along these motorways, the highest need for charging infrastructure arises. Nationwide, two peak times for vehicle charging seem to exist: One is around lunch time and another in the mid-afternoon. During the first peak, overall energy demand is presumably the highest.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 20:36,0/0,,Nowy

","City logistics (CL) is facing with everyday environmental challenges in promoting and developing cleaner transportation environment and reduction of Greenhouse gas emission (GHG) e.g. (60 % reduction of GHG by 2050, European Commission). New technological innovations combined with the usage of renewable energy and electricity sources have a significant environmental influence. One of the evolving technological contribution for creating environmentally friendly urban transport are electric cargo bikes. The interest on electric cargo bikes is becoming significant among big companies like DHL which is expanding its green urban delivery with city hubs. Especially in cities, electric cargo bikes introduce many advantages such as environmental benefits and low operating costs, higher flexibility and reduction of time needed for loading/unloading operations and manipulation from one to another mode of transport, parking flexibility, accessibility to historical and/or zones with traffic limitations, etc. In this work, we assume the application of Internet of Things (IoT) as a basic framework for cargo bike urban freight optimisation. For example, the smart fridge signalizes to customer the food to be ordered and then transmits the order to the delivery company. The operator checks the availability of goods through the Warehouse Management System (WMS). Thus, a Decision Support System (DSS) plans the assignment to electric cargo bikes and the routing process starts. As our contribution, we propose a dynamic optimization system based on a combined routing of electric cargo bikes and vans in CL. First, starting from depot, cargo bikes serve the customers according to an initial optimal vehicle routing. Then, according to new orders, vans are used to distribute the new goods to the cargo bikes, already travelling. The distribution is carried out at transhipment (meeting) points according to an optimal combination of vans and cargo bikes’ routes. The cargo bikes’ routes are updated according to the optimal combination of routes and new orders. In this work, we assume one depot and a fixed number of transhipment points between vans and cargo bikes. The aim of the optimization process is to minimize the total traveling costs and number of vehicles, thus environmental impact. Moreover, the proposed model aims at excluding the opening of new satellites, thus to reduce the number of storage facilities in urban areas. We tested the proposed model on well-known instances in the literature adapted to our formulation. Preliminary results are encouraging and push towards further developments.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 20:58,0/0,,Nowy

","The purpose of dynamic line control systems is to increase traffic safety and optimize traffic flow. The investigated dynamic line control system includes data collection points provided with traffic detectors and variable traffic signs. At each data collection point, speed limits, truck overtaking and warnings for the drivers are automatically regulated depending on the situation and a temporary hard shoulder running is operated where applicable. Through dynamic feedback based on collected data, the system aims at stabilizing traffic flow and maintaining a good level of service. Besides traffic flow data (volume, density and speed), weather conditions and current safety-relevant information such as traffic accidents or construction sites serve as input for the control logic. Especially high traffic volumes result in high emissions so that the question arises whether traffic emissions should be implemented as an additional control criterion in the control logic of dynamic line control systems. The objective of this research is to analyze by means of microscopic traffic flow simulation whether the integration of traffic emissions in the control criteria of a dynamic line control system can lead to a reduction in emissions. To investigate the effects, a traffic flow model of a 30-kilometer section of the German freeway A5, equipped with a dynamic line control system, is built and calibrated in PTV Vissim. The control logic is implemented in Python and integrated in Vissim through the COM interface. The acceptance of the road users towards the displayed speed limits and warnings play a major role in the model. The desired speed distributions must reflect the observed speeds to obtain reliable results. To determine reasonable desired speed distributions in Vissim, data of individual vehicles from the investigated section are analyzed depending on the displayed speed limits, displayed warnings and traffic density using the Kaplan-Meier method and implemented in the model. Traffic emissions are calculated using HBEFA (handbook emission factors for road transport) for air emissions (NOx, PM, CO2) and RLS-90 (guidelines for noise protection on roads) for noise emissions, as these are among the most acknowledged and comparable methods in the field. The calculation methods are converted into a Python-script and integrated in Vissim. Traffic emissions produced in the simulation are calculated continuously during the simulation. Thus, it is possible to implement emissions in the control criteria of the existing control logic. If the emission values exceed a certain threshold value, a pollution-based speed limit is activated. To evaluate the control logic’s influence on resulting traffic emissions, the existing control logic, as it operates currently, is compared to the altered control logic with additional consideration of emissions. An analysis of the emissions shows that the integration of pollution-based control criteria has a positive effect. All air and noise emissions can be slightly reduced by adjusting the control logic, with no significant changes of travel times. This research shows that it is possible to reduce traffic emissions by adapting the control logic of a dynamic line control system.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 21:06,0/0,,Nowy

","The new edition of Highway Capacity Manual introduced a procedure for assessing travel time reliability of highways based on predicted variability of factors that affect travel time. However, it is now possible to investigate the actual reliability of road facilities using probe vehicle travel time observations obtained from ITS systems. With proper data filtering and processing, probe vehicle data make it possible to assess actual travel time reliability of an existing road and to determine where, when and how often traffic congestion occurs. The method helps to identify segments with capacity deficiency. Pilot surveys conducted on S6 expressway in Poland (which were reported in another paper) confirmed the usefulness and reasonable accuracy of probe vehicle data for measuring travel time variations and identifying the location of congested regions. It was found that with the current penetration of GPS equipment, travel times obtained from probe vehicles should be averaged in 1-hour intervals. A new reliability indicator for road segments called “delay index” was proposed. The aim of the current study is to apply the method to investigate the reliability performance of Polish motorways and expressways in order to find congestion location, frequency and severity. Historical probe vehicle data from three Polish motorways (A1, A2, A4) and two expressways (S6, S8) were used to analyze travel time reliability of their sections. The selected segments carry large traffic volumes but have diverse characteristics: some go through or near urban areas, some include toll stations while others are free. All the roads are dual carriageway and each direction was analyzed separately. The total length of segments assessed was 2067.3 km. The analysis period covered four weeks in May 2018 during daytime hours (06-22 hours) on weekdays (Monday-Friday, excluding public holidays). In addition, Friday afternoon peak periods (14-19 hours), when exit routes from urban areas are full of weekend traffic, were examined in detail. For all the selected road segments Travel Time Indexes, Reliability Ratings and Misery Indexes were calculated to identify segments with lower reliability and higher expected delay. For weekdays, it was found that the lowest reliability occurs on segments which perform the role of ring roads in large urban areas as well as segments with manual toll collection stations. Segments of S6 and S8 expressways are characterized on weekdays by large values of the Misery Index. In worst 5% of cases the actual travel time on those roads is more than three times longer than the free flow travel time. For the Friday afternoon peak analysis, delay maps will be compiled to present in one diagram where and when to expect delay and also of what magnitude it is likely to be. For the road segments where low reliability rating was identified, it seems that introduction of an ITS active traffic management system would be highly recommended as it would be of great benefit to the motorists. A probe-vehicle based travel time assessment conducted after such implementation would be a definite proof that ITS systems improve travel time reliability.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 21:10,0/0,,Nowy

","Many transit agencies in the world face the recurring problem of schedule delays, bus bunching, and crowding due to traffic congestion, large-scale events, weather disruptions, and other emergency situations. This paper proposes a multi-modal routing and assignment algorithm that utilizes real-time information on transit travel times and transit vehicle loads, and a prediction method to estimate future travel times and vehicle loads. Using a Poisson-Gamma model, we predict future loads. By future load we mean the load L"" of the transit vehicle at a given stop s"">s, where s is the sequence number of the current stop. The distribution of the future load lambda"" given L is Gamma with parameters alpha"" and beta"", where alpha"" = alpha' + L and beta"" = beta' + 1. alpha' and beta' are the parameters to be estimated. The expectation of the predicted passenger load is alpha""/beta"". To estimate future travel times we use an information mixing method. The future predicted travel time is a weighted sum (w denotes the weight) of the prevailing travel time (multiplied by w) and the historical travel time of the future time interval (multiplied by 1 minus w). The weight w is calculated using a modified two-parameter Weibull survival function. This function results in larger weights, i.e. more trust on prevailing conditions, if the future time interval is close to the current time. The value of w also depends on the magnitude of the two parameters. Both of the prediction methods are incorporated into the Integrated Activity-Based Demand Modeling and Dynamic Traffic-Transit Assignment-Simulation software framework called POLARIS developed at Argonne National Laboratory. In summary, POLARIS generates a realistic population of a chosen study area, creates activities, and then plans those activities in terms of mode, location, and time. To realize these activity plans, travelers route themselves using a time-dependent intermodal A* (TDIMA*) algorithm. This algorithm runs a multimodal network with road, walking, and transit links and generates individual point-to-point routes based on heterogeneous traveler characteristics. The modified version of this algorithm utilizes the load and travel time prediction methods estimated above. The generalized cost that is to be minimized is a weighted sum of travel times (separate weights for walking, waiting, driving, seated in-transit-vehicle, and standing in-transit-vehicle), transfer penalties, monetary costs, and crowding penalties. We have already performed preliminary analysis using the Blooming network in Illinois, a mid-sized network. This work utilizes the demand prediction method. The alpha' and beta' parameters are estimated using former simulation runs with different random number seeds instead of real-world data, The travel times are deterministic using the scheduled travel times. Our future work will include both the demand and supply prediction methods using real-world observations. The studies will be run in the large-scale network of Chicago Metropolitan Region.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 21:24,0/0,,Nowy

","In recent years, we have witnessed an exponential increase in the evolution of information technology and communication. This has made smartphones and mobile data great candidates for becoming a new source of mobility data. In this respect, numerous studies have tried to use mobile data, or more precisely Call Detail Records (CDR), to reconstruct trajectories. However, to our knowledge, until now CDR data is still lacking reliable metrics to assess the results of extracted trajectories. Most of the current studies rely on custom-built evaluation tools as well as self-defined metrics, which are often very case specific. Furthermore, most of the studies are based on custom-collected data, since there is no approved CDR dataset to evaluate the trajectory reconstruction models. In our paper, we are endorsing the standards for collecting CDR ground truth datasets and suggesting a metrics’ evaluation model. Our ideas were aggregated into a tool called ""CDRMob"" which we present in this paper. A case study of the applicability of the suggested metrics is presented with the results of the benchmarking of our own trajectory reconstruction algorithm.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 21:24,0/0,,Nowy

","In a world with sensors and cameras almost everywhere you can wonder if classic transport models are still necessary when mobility patterns can be measured continuously. In this paper we will present the progress we made in the past few years by extracting mobility information from Mobile Phone Data (MPD). MPD can be collected continuously, 24-hours a day and every day of the year (24/7/365). Using these data (more than 12 billion location based events monthly in the Netherlands) both regular and irregular traffic patterns can be determined at local, regional and national scales for any time period, and of course the average working day, which is commonly used for transport policy purposes. In processing and augmenting MPD-data reliable information can be created that can be used for monitoring of traffic, improving the quality of origin-destination matrices in transport models and direct use of these data for determining traffic flows. In transport models many different data sources are used, e.g. socio-economic data, survey data, ANPR data and traffic counts. Our studies show that new techniques that also include MPD can make the modelling process both more efficient and create higher quality models. Regarding the improvement of OD-matrices in transport models, we have performed several studies with the Dutch National Model System and the transport model of the Metropole Region Rotterdam–The Hague. We learned that the distribution, i.e. the structure of the synthetic OD-matrix can be improved significantly by the use of MPD-data. For example, MPD data perform much better for OD-relations that are difficult to model with the gravity model due to historical patterns, due to spatial policy, like the Zoetermeer–The Hague-connection. Also, MPD based OD’s compare much better with commuter data than traditionally build synthetic OD’s. In a number of use cases with MPD we further explored the possibilities of direct use of origin destination information based on mobile sources, so without merging it in a transport model. These use cases comprised the assessment of flows at intersections, selected-link analyses on motorways, and OD-analyses at regional levels. Also fusion of MPD and Floating Car Data (FCD) was part of these use cases. A new use of MPD concerns Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising. For OOH complete traffic flows, i.e. both motorized traffic and slow modes must be assessed at billboard locations. This information is used to determine the value of different advertising locations. Clearly, the availability of up-to-date, dynamic OD-data at a national scale is highly beneficial for this purpose. In this paper we will present the online platform we build with traffic flows fully based on MPD for all roads in the Netherlands, including daily profiles and per hour of the day. For future transport planning transport models still will be necessary to determine growth factors, similar to current practice. A transition to data-driven models for the base year however will become regular practice.",,MB,,,2018-10-31 21:37,0/0,,Nowy

","Efficiently functioning public transport has a significant positive impact on the entire transportation system performance by numerous aspects like reducing congestion, energy consumption, and emissions. In most cases, the basic element of public transport is the bus transport subsystem. Currently, in addition to criteria such as punctuality, a frequency of departures, number of transfers, the comfort of traveling is an important element for the traveler. It may be significantly related to the degree of occupancy and capacity of the bus. An overcrowded bus may discourage the traveler from choosing this mode of transport and induce him to use a private car in spite of many other facilities offered by a given public transport system. Therefore, the forecasting of bus passenger demand and the forecasting of bus occupancy at individual bus stops is currently an important direction of research. Variability and cyclicity in passenger flows make such forecasts extremely useful. From the perspective of transport system planners, they can be used to optimal allocation of resources, type of buses to current demand. From the traveler's point of view, the use of this type of forecast can help to reduce waiting times at the bus stop as well as choose the right departure time. The forecasting methods and techniques used in this area mainly concern long-term prediction. In view of the above, the main goal of the article is to present the framework of the prediction subsystem for Advanced Travel Information System. The proposed model describes a logical view of the proposed model combining functional ITS services such as real-time information for travelers, the dynamic assignment of allowable public transport capacities to demand and short-term in-vehicle occupancy prediction. The main part of the framework is a prediction module, which based on the Markov Chain concept. A high randomness, susceptibility on external factors and behavioral aspects of traveler flows determine that accurate forecasts of bus capacity utilization could be inefficient. Adopting a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event could be a suitable approach for modeling such a process. Efficiency and accuracy of the prediction were presented based on the real-life example, where the measurements of passengers boarding and alighting buses at stops were made in selected bus line in Cracow.",,VN,,,2018-10-31 21:49,0/0,,Nowy

","Ever more observed data on destination and mode choices made by travellers is becoming available from e.g. GSM and ANPR data. Driven by technological advances such as 5G networks and the internet of things, it is expected that the availability, level of spatial detail and the quality of this data will only increase further in the near future. For strategic transport demand modelling, this means that a paradigm shift is occurring. Instead of estimating synthetic models and calibrating them on the limited set of available observations for a single study period definition (e.g. the AM peak of the average work day), different data sources are fused to a 'common operational picture' (CoP) of the total travel demand for many different study period definitions (e.g. different days of the week) and this fused data is parametrized to a synthetic model for application in model forecasts. Three issues arise in the data fusion step. Firstly, inconsistencies between data sources and/or observations need to be detected and removed. Secondly, different data sources need to be weighted and normalized, often without (comparable or usable) reliability measures available. Thirdly, the data fusion problem is underspecified: the level of spatial detail of the transport models (the traffic analysis zones) is higher than the observed data can provide; at least this is the case in most strategic transport models of the Netherlands. The latter will still hold in the future, since removing technical limitations will cause limitations due to privacy reasons to become normative. This paper demonstrates a method that solves all three data fusion problems by using a multi-proportional simultaneous gravity model which: • Threats all data sources as constraints to a maximization problem, thereby avoiding the need to determine weighting factors and automatically detecting inconsistencies as violated constraint-combinations; • Uses entropy maximization as underlying paradigm, thereby enforcing a unique solution, hence removing the under specification. This greatly improves the usability of the CoPs for strategic purposes: when comparing CoPs, all differences are guaranteed to be related to differences in observations, not to differences due to an underspecified data fusion problem. The multi-proportional simultaneous gravity model yields mode-origin-destination specific balancing factors, which are too specific to be transferred from a CoP to a forecast model. Therefore, a tri-proportional simultaneous gravity model is fitted to the fused demand data, thereby parametrizing the fused data into a single (transferable) deterrence parameter per mode. Additionally, the tri-proportional gravity model contains balancing factors for productions and attractions (as these will be available in the forecast model) and mode specific scaling factors (which are transferable). The methodology is used to conduct OD matrix estimation using GSM data, observed modal splits, trip frequency distributions and synthetic trip generation, but can be used to fuse and parametrize any data source that relates to (aggregates of) mode-origin-destination combinations. Anticipated applications include fitting to observed parking occupancies and/or integration of parking constraints into mode/destination choice modelling (as the multi-proportional model has been extended to include inequality constraints).",,MB,,,2018-10-31 21:51,0/0,,Nowy

","Conventional traffic management strategies usually aim to maximize vehicle throughput or minimize vehicle delays. This approach led to growing desire of using private cars and the resulting problem such as traffic congestion and air pollution. In contrast, using user throughput data would be a solution for mentioned challenges in traffic management. This approach not only would cause to prioritize public transit at signalized intersections but also prioritizing high occupancy vehicles in traffic management could be a motivation for shared mobility. Connected vehicles capabilities can enable implementing such strategies in traffic management. Moreover, optimizing signal timing based on user throughput instead of vehicle throughput allows accounting for a range of user types such as pedestrians, cyclist and vehicles in a single multimodal signal timing optimization. In this regard, only a limited amount of studies has proposed control strategies that consider users in signalized intersection optimization so far. The objective of most studies is limited to provide transit signal priority by considering a default number of passengers for private cars and for public transit vehicles in a delay model. In addition, few studies have investigated vehicle-based optimization algorithms effects on user based performance measures. The aim of this research is the development of a signalized intersection control strategy aiming at maximizing user throughput in a connected vehicles environment. The inputs of the proposed optimization algorithm are position and speed of connected vehicles, as well as number of passengers for each of vehicles, while the output is the optimum green time duration for each phase of signal timing. The optimization problem is formulated firstly, by using connected vehicle data to estimate queue length for each lane. Then, discharging time of existing queue is calculated by shockwave theory principles. As speed and position of vehicles that are not in the queue are collected, a conditional analytical formulation is developed to predict when will vehicles pass stop bar based on if a vehicle joins existing queue or not. Finally, based on predicted time and number of users for each vehicle, the optimum green time is calculated for each phase in order to maximize passenger throughput over a signal cycle. Since green time duration of previous phases affects the queue length of the next phases, as well as the predicted time of passing the intersection for each vehicle, the resulting optimization problem is highly non-convex, with a very large feasible solution space. For solving this problem in considerably short computation time, a heuristic genetic algorithm is used. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a numerical simulation for a four-leg isolated intersection with four phases signal control is designed in MATLAB. User throughput and other user-based performance measures, such as delay, obtained via the proposed algorithm are compared with conventional signal control strategies. The proposed user-based algorithm provides a framework for further extensions that can include other transportation modes, such as pedestrians or cyclists.",,RK,,,2018-10-31 21:51,0/0,,Nowy

","Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to increase both safety and capacity of traffic, especially at intersections. In recent years, many studies about reservation-based control systems of intersections taking advantage of the information and communication with approaching vehicles, have been published. So-called autonomous intersection management (AIM) strategies assign each arriving vehicle with a trajectory that this vehicle has to follow. In these studies, other road users such as pedestrians usually play a minor role or are not considered at all. However, many use cases of automated driving occur in the urban environment, where vehicles share the road with pedestrians and bicyclists. This leads to a series of questions: how can pedestrians and bicyclists be considered in an AIM? Do they need to connect to the infrastructure? How can they be sure that they are given the right of way? This paper deals with these questions, introducing relevant studies about the topic and presenting new control strategies for integrating pedestrians into a demand-responsive AIM such that a maximum waiting time for pedestrians can be guaranteed. An urban intersection with both CAVs and pedestrians is simulated where a combination of AIM for vehicles and a dynamic traffic signal for pedestrians is implemented. We present, implement and test different control strategies in the microsimulation environment and present the most important results. In order to implement the control strategy, the considered intersection is divided into different conflict areas. Only one vehicle or a group of pedestrians is allowed to pass a conflict area at a time. It is assumed that vehicles which want to cross the intersection send their position, speed, and desired destination to the AIM system and receive a conflict-free trajectory that they need to follow. This trajectory is calculated according to a first come first serve (FCFS) policy. On the other hand, pedestrians are not connected to the infrastructure but are detected via sensors or cameras when they are already at the intersection. They are allowed to cross the street when pedestrian green light is shown. Different strategies for combining the AIM strategy for vehicles with an on-demand control of the pedestrian traffic light are presented, such as including pedestrians into the FCFS strategy or having fixed cycles for pedestrian phases. All control strategies are tested on a four-leg intersection with pedestrian crossings on each leg using the microsimulation software aimsun.next. The intersection control is implemented using python, and the communication between the intersection control and the simulation is realized using the aimsun.next Application Programming Interface (API). Delays of vehicles and waiting times for pedestrians are calculated and compared with fixed-time traffic signals for different scenarios. Results show that the level of service for pedestrians can be improved while at the same time the average delay of vehicles is decreased.",,RK,TAK,"Very intertesting and up-to-date problem, nicely extending current proof-of-concepts. would like to see in the full paper not only conceptual framework, but also methodological contributions.",2018-10-31 22:02,0/0,,Nowy

","The work presents a review of selected Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in Poland. In the vast majority of the 29 cities that have been classified by the Central Statistical Office in Poland as the largest cities in terms of population, the ITS already exist. In article selected the ITS in cities with the largest population and where the system was implemented comprehensively ie it was implemented as one integrated system. In the case of the already built urban ITS systems, the assessment of the implementation was carried out, among others, on the basis of earlier assumed indicators. These indicators were usually limited to a relative reduction of travel time in the area covered by the project, calculated separately for individual and public transport. Due to implementation of the priority for public transport assumed a stronger effect of reducing the travel time by public vehicles than the individual one. The values of the travel time reduction were planned at around 5-10%. Post-implementation descriptions of systems also indicate qualitative indicators, such as reducing the number of stops, obtaining traffic improvement, increasing safety and a more efficient response to the occurring events. In connection with the above, the authors have compiled the essential functions and roles of selected systems as well as obtained quantitative and qualitative indicators of implementations. The article also presents the classification of the particular ITS, which was implemented on the basis of the obtained data and which includes, inter alia, the cost of building the system, population, implemented subsystems and the number of intersections with traffic lights covered by the ITS system. This compilation allows to see existing correlations between selected parameters and to determine trends and dependencies of individual values. Another important element of the work is the analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for selected ITS. These indicators allow to determine the values achieved through the use of ITS systems and monitor their current effectiveness. The indicators are, among others, recommended by the EU in order to uniform and standardize the assessment of the effects of implementing ITS road systems. As a result of literature research selected KPI that are possibly to be calculate from available data and referred those KPI to selected projects and implementations of ITS in Poland. The authors also pay attention to the need for changes in the approach to the implementation of ITS systems or applications, which should take into account the needs of end users of the system. The association of the consumer with the values offered by ITS allows for the determination of a long-lasting and effective strategy for the implementation and development of systems.",,RK,TAK,,2018-10-31 22:18,0/0,,Nowy

","The past decades, socioeconomic factors and the attributes of transport alternatives have been the key elements considered in most models used to support stakeholder planning (Shiftan et al., 2008). However, the decision making process (in our case mode choice behavior) is also influenced by psychological factors such as attitudes, perceptions, motivation to comply that in turn are influenced by the opinions and behaviors of the decision makers’ social environment (Van de Bos et al., 2013; Abou- Zeid & Ben-Akiva, 2011; Rose & Hensher, 2004; Brock & Durlauf, 2001; Polydoropoulou et al., 2013; Kamargianni et al., 2014). Furthermore, innovation within the automotive sector has unraveled new opportunities for products and services in transportation. Due to the latest technological advancements, sharing systems are already part of the transportation systems in many countries and autonomous vehicles (AV) are closer to becoming a reality and it is quite certain that they will be part of global mobility in the near future. Despite the fact that there are several studies for individuals’ mode choice, they focus mainly in urban areas, using mostly scenarios of existent mobility schemes. This paper aims at investigating the decision making behavior of inhabitants and tourists in insular areas focusing on the choice of innovative mobility schemes by developing a hybrid choice model. Data collected includes approximately 250 individuals and 200 tourists. For the model estimation we use Stated Preference observations (SP experiments were presented to each participant). The SP experiments presented to the individuals the weather conditions, the purpose of their trip and asked them to choose the transport mode that they would use for their short and long distance trips (less/more than 1.5km). The experiments have randomly six of the following alternatives: 1. Walking, 2. Bicycle, 3. Electric bike, 4. Bike sharing, 5. Car-sharing, 6. Park & Ride, 7. Autonomous Bus, 8. Use the same mode I use now. The attributes of the alternatives are travel time, travel cost, walking time from origin to the point where the mode is available and waiting time to hire the mode, and comfort communicated through the existence of sidewalks and bike-paths. We also collected psychometric indicators regarding participants’ attitudes to construct the latent variables. This paper adds to the investigation of travel behavior in small communities and insular areas, as most of the existing research work focuses on urban environments. The results offer insights for tailored policies focusing on switching modes and promoting innovative transport modes for daily trips. The findings of this study are expected to assist transport policy makers when making decisions for rural and/or island areas with similar characteristics.","References 1. Abou-Zeid, M., and M.

","ICT technologies implementation and consequent data availability represent nowadays a great opportunity for researchers to advance knowledges, and for city/infrastructure managers to improve the effectiveness of their governance actions. This new opportunity has given boost to the adoption in the field of transportation engineering of data driven approaches for the solution of various issues such as traffic state estimation or travel time prediction. Although interesting, these techniques miss the deep knowledge of physical phenomena typical of the classical model-based approaches, which remains relevant. In this work we present a hybrid approach to the traffic prediction, which incorporates in classical model based techniques information coming from various sources of data (e.g. section data collected h24 with 5 minutes frequency, floating car data, etc…). Our solution is applied to a real context, at city scale, and is based on a relevant amount of data (the database of collected data consists of more than 3 millions of records).

","Traffic prediction, both short-term and long-term, has gained a lot of momentum over the recent years and one of the crucial factors that shape ITS. Tools for traffic management, control, simulations use both historical and real-time data to model traffic in urban areas as well as on the highways. In building the model and prediction, quality of data plays an important role. Traffic data collected through sensors (e.g. inductive loop detectors) installed in the road network often contains anomalies due to malfunctioning of sensors, communication failures etc. Accidents, short-time road-blocks etc. produce data that make building models and predictions hard. On the other hand, alternative traffic patterns such as holidays, calendar events etc. are worth learning though may not be useful for regular traffic modeling. All of these unusual traffic data points or anomalies affect traffic modeling a lot. As the anomalies bias the result (accuracy) of prediction, these need to be dealt with (removed, replaced, modeled differently etc.). There are a few barriers that make the anomaly detection troublesome. First, the definition of anomaly differs from case to case basis. Hence, a detection method needs to be extensible, modular, and flexible to cope up with different definitions and types of anomalies. Second, the size of the historical data makes data annotation by humans an almost impossible process since encompassing all types of anomalies requires a huge labeled dataset. So, a detection method should, preferably, employ unsupervised learning strategies. Third, as new data becomes available, traffic patterns may change and what used to an anomaly may become a regular pattern in the future. This paper provides a robust anomaly detection method for traffic time series data which can be deployed to work in real-time. The proposed method does not assume labeled historical data yet learns from it and uses expert feedback to deal with the fluid definition of anomaly. This paper exemplifies and evaluates the feasibility of the proposed approach by applying the method to real-world traffic time series data collected through real induction loop detectors installed in an urban road-network in Europe. Employing the proposed method as a preprocess of traffic modeling and prediction can increase the accuracy measure as well as ease the learning of different traffic patterns.",,RK,TAK,Interesting definitions of anomaly and novel approach.

","The research described considers how we might use real-time predictive control and information (derived from both the trucks themselves and the surrounding environment) in order to improve the fuel efficiency of the journeys they make. While there have been many previous local-level analyses of how to improve the fuel efficiency of powertrains, and several strategic-level studies of the environmental efficiency of overall supply chains, there has been a erelative paucity of research at the 'tactical' level of how to improve the current leg of a journey by considering downstream impacts. At this level we consider the consequences of unexpected delays, which may be caused by incidents or unusual demand levels, with the aim to potentially re-plan the way in which the current leg of a tour will be made. By considering downstream impacts (up to the next delivery/pickup), decisions can be made as to whether to change the choice of route for the current leg, to alter driver break-points on this leg, or to alter the ‘target speed’ on the current and subsequent links so as to avoid negative consequences downstream. This dynamic routing and control problem is formulated as a novel form of space-time extended network, allowing the use of standard static shortest path problems to solve it. We demonstrate how the formulation may capture various characteristic types of problem, ranging from departure time choice, to choice of when and where to make stops, to whether to stop or make a change of route in response to incidents. The overall problem is viewed as one of multi-objective optimization, trading off fuel efficiency with travel time and arrival time penalties.

","Stochastic process models provide a flexible way of representing both the transient effects and uncertainty involved with travellers' adaptation mechanisms for choice of route or service in private and public transport networks. When such processes possess the markov property, many theoretical results may be brought to bear to guarantee desirable properties of the resulting system, e.g. existence of a unique stationary distribution and ergodicity. Previously such models have been represented in discrete-time, but this gives rise to a technical difficulty in reflecting impacts of real-time information, in that then time period t conditions may affect time period t decisions, thus violating the markov property. In the present paper, a continuous time stochastic process is formulated for this problem. In this formulation, an 'information agent' collects information on current conditions, and at 'event points' (e.g. competion of a journey) information is fed to current/future travellers. It is shown that this formulation retains the markov property. Through examples and simulation experiments, the model is illustrated and contrasted with discrete-time approaches.",,RK,TAK,,2018-11-01 00:07,0/0,,Nowy

","Traffic-responsive signals that react to approaching vehicles have become known with the first successful implementation of SCOOT (Hunt et al., 1981). Nowadays they are widely used e.g. for temporarily operating traffic lights or to control complex intersections in an efficient way, e.g. by locally maximizing throughput or minimizing waiting times. Different levels of adjustment are distinguished: Actuated signal control methods use a fixed-time base plan and e.g. adjust green times. In contrast, (fully) adaptive signal control methods decide about the signal stages on the fly only based on sensor data. All traffic-responsive approaches have in common that they directly influence waiting times of travelers (users) at intersections and, thereby, influence user reaction, e.g. route choice. On the other hand, users route choice directly influences sensor data and, thereby, the signal settings controlled by traffic-responsive signals. Thus, the interference of route choice and traffic-responsive signals constitutes a combined problem. This work focuses on a detailed simulation-based analysis of the effects of route choice on the performance of different traffic-responsive signal algorithms. The agent-based transport simulation MATSim is used. In MATSim, agents follow their daily activity chains, traveling on the network and interacting with other travelers. Adaptive signals can be modeled that control the outflow of links and react to approaching vehicles (see e.g. Thunig et al., 2018). When all agents have reached their destinations, the agents score their experienced plans and some agents are allowed to re-plan (e.g. re-route) for the next day. This iterative process is repeated until a stable state -- a (stochastic) user equilibrium -- has reached and no agent can unilaterally improve anymore. If traffic signals improve travel times on specific routes, travelers will react and more travelers will use these routes. Analogously, if traffic signals improve travel times in the whole inner city, it may cause more traffic through the inner city (induced traffic). Therefore, it is important to take the combined problem of route choice and traffic-responsive signals into account when evaluating signal control methods. This study contributes to a wider understanding of this combined problem by analyzing fixed-time signals, traffic-actuated signals and traffic-adaptive signals and their interaction with route choice in a scenario of the city of Cottbus, Germany, which contains 22 signalized intersections in the inner city and a large surrounding network. It Is found that the better the signal control without user adaption, the more induced traffic can be observed when agents are allowed to change routes. Traveled distances decrease, i.e. more direct routes are used; delays increase (in comparison to the case without user adoption) and more users travel through the inner city. Furthermore, the effect of different levels of saturation on the interaction of route choice and signal control are analyzed. It is found that the higher the overall saturation, the higher the potential improvements in delay and, therefore, the higher the impacts of route choice on the signal performance.",,RK,TAK,,2018-11-01 00:24,0/0,,Nowy

","The assignment model, representing the relationship between travel demand and flows on the network, plays a key role in almost all applications in both planning and transport network management. Although synthetic approaches have recently spread, the explicit representation and interpretation of the travel behavior is an indispensable tool for an effective traffic management in all non-recurring situation, where travel demand and / or supply change significantly, as well as in planning field where the network set up has to be designed . Although there are countless specifications for the assignment model, its reliability and dispersion structure are rarely discussed in the literature, therefore the assignment matrix is treated as deterministic. However, considering the error that an assignment model introduces both in the estimation of network performances and in the OD matrix estimation based on the traffic measures, in this paper this aspect will be addressed. The assignment model involves a flow propagation model, which, in the case of uncongested network or travel times known, can be expressed in linear relationships, and a route choice model typically non-linear with respect the problem variables. Considering the non-linearity, a theoretical approach to the estimate of the dispersion of model outputs appears cumbersome, nevertheless it may be useful to evaluate this dispersion numerically through laboratory experiments in a controlled environment. In more details, with reference to a real context about network topology and flow propagation, several populations will be randomly generated consistently with different route choice models and the corresponding model will be calibrated based on several samples extracted by the population with different sampling rate. The sample may be, based on the assumed data collection technique, a set of users whose entire route is known or floating car of which only some subsequent location data are known. In this context the sampling rate can be varied both in terms of percentage of users detected and in terms of complete or partial knowledge of the path followed. For each model and sampling rate, several draws and calibration will be carried out in order to evaluate numerically the dispersion of the model outputs that combined with flow propagation models provide the assignment matrix. In this context several questions arise and can be numerically addressed. First of all, the dispersion of the assignment matrix can be evaluated in an ideal hypothesis of a model perfectly consistent with that used to generate the population and also according to established levels of error with respect the context assumed as reality. It will also be possible to assess how the errors of assignment models affect the flows when the travel demand is known and/or the matrix estimation when some flows are known. Finally, the effect of the spatial disaggregation level about the travel demand can be investigated, that is, if more aggregated demand, and therefore routes limited to hierarchically higher links in the network, leads to a greater or lower uncertainty in the assignment matrix and in the estimation of flows or of OD matrix based on traffic measures.",,RK,TAK,,2018-11-01 00:36,0/0,,Nowy

","The paper presents a new approach to the description of spatial accessibility in the region based on railway transport using the so-called ""self-training"" model. The ""self- training "" procedure results from the transformation of the functionality of an allocation model based on the mechanism of ""intervening opportunities"". This approach is based on a relatively simple assumption to induce the model to transform the uniform distribution of potentials into the real state of the population of the studied regions, which is known in advance to the model. The process itself takes place sequentially using changes in the parameter of the selectivity that dynamically adapts to the evolution taking place in the entire system to achieve the actual (current) value of population potential in the computational regions. In practice, it looks like the parameter sharpens selectivity in regions that have already reached the final level of potential they aspired to avoid attracting more units. In the same time, they ease selectivity in those regions that still show a deficiency. The whole process is dynamic, so observing the fluctuation of the selectivity parameter allows to indicate the chronological sequence achieved by the regions of the filling level by the allocated potentials. Because this process is based on a network of spatial connections, the simulation process largely reflects the spatial accessibility structure in individual parts of the region. Because the inherent rail network is much less developed and more concentric in relation to the road network, its operation requires greater concentration of users near the railway lines. The assumption of this approach is to determine the potential transport relations within the region, it was decided to apply a change in relation to the classical ""self-training"" model, distributing origin potentials evenly in the main centers representing the largest cities of the region at the same time excluding them from the simulation process (recreating the actual population) omitting the destination potential in them. As a result, the structure of the simultaneous impact of the largest settlement units on their regional surroundings was obtained (in the sense of the impact of spatial relations operated only by railway lines).",,VN,,,2018-11-01 00:47,0/0,,Nowy

","Urban congestion is a major issue in modern metropolitan areas, as it has implications in the economy, the environment, and the quality of life. During peak hours, transport networks face serious traffic jams and the performance of the available infrastructure degrades significantly. Assuming that we have a given demand that cannot be managed, we are interested in exploring ways to increase the supply capacity of the network and provide a better level of service to the users (commuters). Real-time traffic management through traffic signal control has attracted a lot of attention recently. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice strategies cannot deal efficiently with oversaturated conditions (i.e. queue spillbacks and partial gridlocks), as they are designed based on simplified models and/or heuristics, and in many instances, they fail to replicate accurately the propagation of congestion in cities. An approach that has gained a lot of attention recently is the co-called perimeter control, or gating. In such an approach, we can identify homogeneous zones in a city and critical entrances/exits (gates) that can regulate the inflow/outflow of these zones. This concept utilizes the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD), or Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), which is an easy and practical way to monitor the performance of different zones. NFD provides an elegant way to relate network density (veh/km) and production (veh.km) and is very useful from a control viewpoint. In this work, we study the impact that connected vehicles can have in this type of control. Real-time communication of location, distance, and speed can enhance the performance of feedback-type traffic controllers. Moreover, after the gating flows have been delivered by the controller, we study different ways of distributing them to the different gates. Our investigations compare the case of uniform flow distribution to the different gates, versus a distribution that takes into account the spatial correlations of congestion between zones. A simple methodology is proposed, that considers spatial network properties that are revealed from real-time data, and can distribute the flows to the gates more efficiently. A traffic microsimulation tool is used in order to assess the impact of the proposed approaches to the overall traffic conditions. An urban network is simulated with a realistic OD matrix and we investigate different control scenarios; the simulation outputs are compared to the ones we get if we apply the default signal settings that are currently used in the field. Preliminary results demonstrate that a smart distribution of the gated inflow/outflow can significantly improve the system performance. Moreover, data provided by connected vehicle technologies can enhance the effectiveness of the designed feedback controllers. Simulation results demonstrate a positive impact in the travel times of vehicles and other environmental factors.",,RK,TAK,Very interesting extension of MFD.

","Freight transportation is considered as one of the most crucial components of the United States economy. During the last two decades, the freight movements on highways had been increased by % contributing to the high levels of congestion on road networks. Current researches show an Increased number of freight movements in urban metropolitan areas in the near future, raising concerns to traffic engineers and experts in this field worldwide. Nevertheless, truck movements due to their slow dynamics, their increased time of deceleration and acceleration have a negative impact on the vehicle and the transit movements as well, projecting the urge for separating the truck movements from the passengers’ vehicles for resolving this problematic situation. Various studies conducted on multi-modal corridors recognized the importance of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) components for improving the freight movement operations and the overall network operations. Thus, Freight Signal Priority (FSP), the descendant of Transit Signal Priority (TSP), improves simultaneously the performance of freight and overall network’s movements. The FSP consists of traffic operation strategies that are “shaped” to provide priority to trucks, reduce the number of stops and respectively reduce delay and travel time of the trucks and the rest of the vehicles. The primary objective of the study is the implementation of numerous Freight Signal Priority strategies on multi-modal corridors and the simultaneous evaluation of their interaction with the rest of the traffic network. The goal is to evaluate possible improvements in freight mobility, along an arterial network with high freight and transit volumes, while sustaining good transit and vehicle services, through the implementation of the FSP. In addition, the FSP strategies aim to provide a high safety environment for all modes of transport that are caused by truck movements and smoother overall traffic operations by reducing the overall network congestion. The operational concept, developed for the FSP implementation, aims to assess the impact of the strategy on freight movements individually and on the overall transportation network. The effectiveness of the newly established guidelines and criteria were evaluated through a real-world case study in South East Florida, build up using micro-simulation platform, also used for assessment of recommended strategies in the concept of operations. The results of this study showed a reduction on the delays and travel times for the freight movements and for the overall network as well, while the FSP strategies had a minimum to zero impact on the side roads. Future research studies should be oriented on the variables and criteria for implementing successfully the FSP.",,VN,,,2018-11-01 02:53,0/0,,Nowy

","With the automation of vehicles, new forms of operating public transport might evolve. By reducing the staff costs, it can become feasible to provide more flexible services that operate on-demand. How such services would be perceived and how their introduction would impact mode choice behaviour remains however unknown. In this study, a stated mode choice experiment has been conducted as part of a pilot study with automated busses crossing the Dutch-German border (I-AT Interreg Automated Transport). The results of this choice experiment contribute to a more specific understanding of the perception by current public-transport users of automated vehicles and the way they may choose to use on-demand public transport services. The choice experiment focuses on the mode-choice behaviour of commuters having the option to either travel with a regular bus or a fully automated, self-driving bus. In the stated-choice experiment, the self-driving bus is described by different attributes in regard to surveillance (information system, interactive communication system or steward) and in regard to its operation (scheduled or demand-responsive). Answers from 282 respondents from the Netherlands and Germany, who participated in an online survey, are analysed. Next to the stated-choice experiment, respondents were asked to indicate their perception towards 15 attitudinal statements. The statements pertained to the trust towards the safety of automated vehicles, general interest in technology, perceived convenience of automated vehicles and perception of the surveillance systems featured in the choice-experiment. A factor analysis based on principal axis factoring (PAF) has been conducted. The factor analysis revealed a clear 2-factor structure. The two factors – “trust in automated vehicles” and general “interest in technology” - explain 58% of the total variance between the variables. Next to a multi-nominal logit (MNL) model, a sequential integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model has been estimated. The psychometric factors are included in the choice model as latent covariates. The choice model is estimated as a mixed logit model. Respondents who show a high level of “trust in automated vehicles” and /or show a high level of “interest in technology” are much more likely to opt for the self-driving bus than those scoring low for these factors. The effect of “trust in automated vehicles” is even higher for female respondents than for male ones. The current level of using public transport impacts positively the perceived utility of the self-driving bus, but is only significant at p",,MB,,,2018-11-01 08:36,0/0,,Nowy

","New technologies such as ""connected"" and ""autonomous"" vehicles are going to change the future of traffic signal control and management and possibly will introduce new traffic signal systems that will be based on floating car data (FCD). The use of floating car data to regulate, in real-time, traffic signal systems has the potential for an increased sustainability of transportation in terms of energy efficiency, traffic safety and environmental issues. However, research has never explored how not ""connected"" vehicles would benefit by the implementation of such systems. This paper explores the use of floating car data to regulate in real-time traffic signal systems in terms of cooperative-competitive paradigm between ""connected"" vehicles and conventional vehicles. Game theory can be applied both in the implementation of algorithms and in assessing driver choices to participate in a cooperating and/or competitive signal regulation system so a dedicated laboratory has been developed for testing regulation algorithms and interactions among drivers. Results show that vehicles which are not ""connected"", in most simulated cases, also benefit when real time traffic signal settings based on floating car data are introduced. Moreover, the study estimates the energy and air quality impacts of FCD signal regulation by evaluating fuel consumption and pollutant emissions with different algorithms. Specifically, the study demonstrates that in most cases significant improvements in air quality are possible with the introduction of FCD regulated traffic signals.",,VN,,,2018-11-01 12:27,0/0,,Nowy

","Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are emerging as promising solutions to improve urban mobility. In particular, taxi services based on AVs (also known as robotaxis) present the potential to reduce energy consumption and crash occurrences, to cut driving costs, and to minimize urban space occupancy for parking purposes. As a result, they could provide lower-cost alternatives to car users and offer new possibilities to public transport users either entirely substituting a conventional mass transit mode or assuring a last mile service in complementarity with conventional modes. The objective of the proposed paper is twofold: (i) to explore future users’ acceptability, and (ii) to define key performance indicators (KPIs) allowing operators to efficiently plan and assess their service. User acceptability is explored through a large-scale survey at the Palaiseau area in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. The specific site was chosen because an AV taxi service is going to be implemented in the area in 2019. A stated-preferences analysis using logistic regression allowed to elicit user preferences regarding willingness-to-pay and operational characteristics of the new service. We specifically explore the time effects on utility and preferences. Two-side effects were identified: some users are willing to use the AV service for a first period before returning to their default mode (‘adventurers’) while others are willing to test the new service only after a first period of 3 to 6 months in order to be reassured about technical and safety issues (‘conservative’ users). Operator perspective is explored by first defining assessment criteria including geographical and time coverage, targeted public, operational characteristics, pricing policy,total period of operation , type of vehicle used, and type of traffic control. Then we test thirty AV services against the criteria previously defined. We thus define KPIs capable to assess technical and financial performance in different contexts: urban vs. rural area, last-mile vs. door-to-door service, taxi vs. fixed schedule, and so on.",,RK,TAK,Very interesting and challenging research problem.

","The safety level of a specific road element can be explained in an analytical way as the product of risk and exposure. The risk is defined as the probability that a unit of exposure is involved in a crash, or in other surrogate safety measures. The most common measure of exposure is the yearly average daily traffic (ADT). The relationship between crashes and ADT is generally not linear, reproducing in some way the well-known safety-in-numbers effect. Some recent studies have demonstrated that the use of alternative measures of exposure, such as encounters between VRUs and vehicles at intersections, might have a linear relationship with crashes, allowing to estimate the risk of that specific site just considering the rate of the considered measure of safety. This linear relationship basically moves the safety-in-numbers effect to the relationship between traffic and encounters. In this framework the definition of what an encounter is can be determinant in the definition of the final shape of the relationship between exposure and the considered measure of safety. In other terms, encounters that consider groups of road users might explain the safety-in-numbers effect if every single user of the group is considered to interact at the same way with all the users of the conflicting maneuver that are entering the intersection. In this case, the risk of the first users of the platoon cannot be assumed the same of the following users. However, the previous observational based study was limited to how many different locations that could be studied. By using these studies as a base for a VISSIM model it is possible to simulate the effect of varying levels of traffic and different designs have on the result found by the observational study. This allows this study to further test the hypothesis that by considering only one road user in a group of road users when defining an encounter, the resulting relationship between traffic volume and encounters is non-linear and decreasing, similar to that normally found between crashes and traffic volume.",,MK,TAK,,2018-11-02 14:29,0/0,,Nowy

","A promising direction for improving the efficiency and safety of road traffic is taking into account ergonomic requirements when organizing road traffic in cities. The basis of the organization of road traffic is accounting for the mechanism of action of emotions that determine the entire indicative activity of the driver. The magnitude of emotional stress is influenced by both the speed of the vehicle and its position in the traffic flow, and the characteristics of the organization of traffic. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve the organization of road traffic, taking into account the human factor. To ensure ergonomic requirements, it is necessary to organize the traffic considering the peculiarities of the functioning of the sense organs of the driver. This applies to the placement of road signs, pointers, traffic lights, etc. For recording ECG Holter monitor with electrodes was used. Neulog GSR was used to record the GSR, stickies of the electrodes were placed on the test subject's fingers. As the main characteristics of the functional state of the driver's body, indicators of the state of the cardiovascular system were used: average and instantaneous pulse rate, shift in heart rate, variational characteristics of the pulse and their secondary indicators (index of autonomic balance IAB, index of regulatory systems tension SI, vegetative rhythm index VRI, indicator of the adequacy of regulation process IARP), characteristics of the dynamic range of RR intervals, an integral indicator of the activity of regulatory body systems IARBS. To register the vehicle speed in synchronization with ECG and GSR in real time, the VideoVbox recorder was used. It has been established that the driver, as a rule, automatically adjusts to some level of emotional tension that is optimal for him, and the speed of the car’s movement acts as a regulator of this level. Therefore, on sections of the road where ergonomic requirements are not met, the driver compensates for the possible increase in emotional stress by a corresponding decrease in speed. Moreover, the more difficult is the certain part of the road for the driver, the bigger is this decrease in speed. If the driver passes these areas without reducing the speed, then this leads to an increase in the level of emotional tension. Prolonged emotional stress is a source of fatigue and a decrease in driver performance. This ultimately leads to a large number of driver errors on the road, which can lead to a traffic accident. As a result of research, a method of considering the human factor in the design of urban traffic conditions was proposed. Designing road conditions taking into account the regulatory action of emotions will help increase the average speed of a vehicle and reduce the likelihood of accidents. This method considering the requirements of ergonomics allows eliminating dangerous areas on the road. After the elimination of hazardous areas, an increase in the road’s carrying capacity, a reduction in congestion, an increase in the efficiency of drivers and a decrease in their level of fatigue are expected.","The paper prepares for special section Ergonomics and human factor on transport.

","The increase in the level of automobilization leads to saturation and glut of the city’s transport system with traffic flows. This leads to an excess of traffic over the capacity of the road network and the emergence of queues of vehicles and traffic jams, especially at the intersections of roads in the morning and evening peak periods. Congestion is a problem in almost all large cities and leads to a decrease in the speed of vehicles and an increase in the time of delivery of goods and passengers to their destinations. The transport system is a complex, self-organizing system with its own peculiarities and characteristics. The active element of this system is the driver, his state largely determines the effectiveness of his work. Depending on the emotional state of the driver, the psycho-physiological indicators of his work also change. Negative emotions caused by excessive restriction of the driver’s freedom of activity and the unsatisfactory state of the traffic organization lead to a disruption in the driver’s mode of work, his emotional stress and, ultimately, to the development of fatigue. Excessive level of fatigue increases the response time of the driver and increases the likelihood of a traffic accident. To achieve the goal of the study, the following tasks were set: the choice and justification of a method for assessing the level of driver’s fatigue and the development of a model for changing the level of fatigue of an average driver. In this paper, an analysis of methods for assessing the functional state was carried out. It showed that the most complete and informative is the assessment of the functional state of the driver's body by recording an electrocardiogram to determine his level of fatigue. The analysis of the functioning of the human cardiovascular system is basic to determine the level of operator fatigue. In addition, the irregularity of heart contractions – cardiointervals is analyzed. This is an integral assessment of the fatigue of the human body. This technique is based on the theory that the irregularity of cardiointervals is directly proportional to the level of fatigue, which in literary sources is usually called an indicator of the activity of the body’s regulatory systems. Linear and nonlinear models of the effect of traffic congestion on the level of fatigue of the average driver have been developed, which allow assessing their condition depending on the age of the driver and the duration of the congestion. The regularities of the influence of traffic parameters on the functional state of the driver are determined. The level of fatigue of the driver increases during his stay in the jam. So, the duration of the congestion and the initial level of fatigue of the driver when entering the congestion affect the final level of his fatigue most of all. The age of the driver affects the level of fatigue to a lesser extent, but significantly. It was also revealed that the functional status of drivers with different temperaments changed differently during their stay in traffic jams.","The paper prepares for special section Ergonomics and human factor on transport.

","One of the main concern when Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) safety is considered, is the interaction with vehicular traffic. In the case of the pedestrian, it is related to the interaction at the pedestrian crossing, and it mainly depends on the design and the control strategy for the crossing itself. The basic criterion deciding the choice of a particular type of pedestrian crossing is road safety. At the same time, the introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is opening new questions based on the effects of the different type of pedestrian crossing based on different levels of penetration of AVs in traffic flow. The safety effects of treatments implemented to solve safety problems can become ineffective or even can worsen the safety conditions in presence of AVs. The main objective of the research study is to evaluate the influence of different levels of penetration of AVs in traffic flow in the safety benefit delivered by the implementation of various scenarios for pedestrian crossing. To evaluate those safety benefits, a simulation model was built in VISSIM® and calibrated on the basis of research results on observed data about drivers and pedestrians behavior. The vehicles flow was modified considering different levels of penetration of AVs. The comparison between before and after conditions (based on the share of AVs) was based on Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM) such as the conflicts frequency, the Time to Collision (TTC) and Post Encroachment Time (PET). Those parameters were estimated using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). It is expected that the penetration of AVs in traffic flow can able to considerably increase safety at the pedestrian crossing to make the effects of any classical countermeasure negligible. In other terms, it is expected that based on the share of AVs the effects of the treatments change till to became negligible for the higher levels penetration considered, with a sensible reduction of severe conflicts (lower values of TTC). VRUs are generally not connected users this makes them vulnerable not only from a physical point of view but also unable to get I2V information and to elaborate them based on their choices. The present research work is a first step to identify safety effects for a pedestrian crossing in presence of AVs. The microsimulation model was calibrated on observed behavioral parameters and simulate the observed traffic operation conditions of the real site. Unfortunately, model validation is not possible when even a small share of AVs is considered in traffic flow.",,MK,,,2018-11-04 22:19,0/0,,Nowy

","The intelligent transport systems (ITS) is the key enabling technology to improve road safety, traffic efficiency and driving experience. There is currently a trend to deploy this new technology in vehicles to enable them to communicate not only with hotspots, but also with other nearby entities through direct short-range communications, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The benefits span a range of areas, including improving road safety, reducing congestion, optimizing transport efficiency, enhancing mobility, increasing service reliability, reducing energy use and environmental impacts, and supporting economic development. A proper infrastructure is needed to support communications in road transportation, regarding the new mobility patterns. Especially for autonomous vehicles, reliability and precision are of the utmost importance. For such vehicles, V2I is safety-critical component of ITS. It is a combined system with integration of vehicular ad hoc networks and roadside infrastructures, including roadside units, traffic surveillance systems, mobile networks and Internet, which are connected through V2I communications. Today as a new-generation mobile communication technology, 5G is undergoing active development. The 5G applications centered at ultra-high data rate support with super-low latency and superb reliability render a promising enabler for self-driving smart vehicles (SV). More importantly, 5G’s unique features, such as a data-control–separated software-defined network, flexible network architecture and topology, cloud computing and processing, and application-oriented design, renders it not only a vital supporting technology for SVs but also an integrated part of the SV system itself. During operation of the SV numerous sensors via its onboard units generate a large amount of data. The ITS big data processing can be centralized or distributed. The centralized approach utilizes the power of cloud computing. However, the requirements for speed, reliability and completeness of data processing in a centralized system with hundreds of such dynamic objects as SV cannot be provided. Such big data collection at a centralized data center generates high network overhead. In contrast to cloud computing, intelligent data processing with faster responses and higher quality can be provided by fog computing. Fog computing is a horizontal, system-level architecture that distributes computing, storage, control and networking functions closer to the users along a cloud-to-thing continuum. Basically, data processing is parallelized at the network edge by fog computing technologies, which fulfil the low latency requirements and reduces the network overhead. However, implementing fog computing in the dynamic environment of ITS to provide real-time big data analytics is facing many challenges that are not covered by previous research studies. The article analyzes the availability of V2I services in distributed communication network of ITS with fog-based architecture from reliability point of view. The dependability of V2I services for end users of smart vehicle in fog operating ITS is defined. The mathematical model of the reliability of a separate dedicated service in fog-based ITS for end user applications in the real conditions of operation is developed.",,VN,,,2018-11-05 13:23,0/0,,Nowy

","The introduction of autonomous vehicles in road traffic will eliminate the impact of the human factor from the decision-making process of drivers and will push for the introduction of the criteria for road network design, road infrastructure management, traffic modeling and assessment of tools for road safety management. The paper presents a microsimulation approach for the assessment of safety performance of unconventional turbo roundabouts in circumstances where different percentages of autonomous ""AVs"" vehicles are mixed with conventional vehicles ""CVs"". Nowadays the turbo roundabouts can be with or without separation in the inner lanes. The formers are present in the Netherlands, Slovenia, Hungary and almost all the stated of the Balkan are, while the latter, using only road markings are mainly located in Germany, Poland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Canada, and the United States. The present research work, through analysis of the vehicle trajectories from VISSIM and subsequent analysis of traffic conflicts, analyzed with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) allows testing the safety benefit of the two layouts of turbo roundabout considering different percentages of AVs. The results pointed out as the safety level varies at varying of the share of autonomous vehicles in the traffic flow and that considering only the conventional traffic composition the presence of lane separation is effective in avoiding conflicts in the inner lanes, while it becomes less effective at the increasing of the AVs penetration. In particular, for high percentages of AVs, the presence of the physical separation does not lead to an increase of safety, a condition that seems to be supported by the fact that autonomous vehicles completely remove the human error from driving. The results suggest again that the microsimulation is a powerful tool for the safety assessment of any road entity based on surrogate measures of safety on the condition to validate the models and use the right behavioral models at the microscopic level for describing the AVs. The methodology seems to be a promising approach for conventional and unconventional roundabout safety performance evaluation.",,MK,,,2018-11-05 14:05,0/0,,Nowy

","This paper presents and analyses Big Data in transport applications and use cases with the aim to understand the Big Data in transport landscape and to present the most important datasets that are being used in this sector. Data size grows tremendously every day, but not all transport organisations use it to derive insights and make decisions. Though Big Data has been the next big technology phenomenon for a long time, transport organisations are still evaluating ways to successfully leverage Big Data and analytics to create a better customer experience, to achieve organisation objectives and to gain a competitive advantage (innovate). Things are changing quite fast and the same happens in the transportation sector. Powered by Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, the transportation system can become safer, more efficient and smarter. In this paper we present Big Data in transport applications and Big Data in transport use cases in an attempt to have an overview of the Big Data in transport landscape and to examine the most common datasets that are being collected and used by transport organisations when working with Big Data. The review is based on: a) extensive research conducted in the literature where there is a number of scientific articles and blog posts mentioning Big Data in transport use cases, b) EU funded projects in transport, c) NOESIS Big Data in Transport Library. The review of Big Data applications includes: BestMile (Switzerland), StreetLight Data (USA), Uber (USA), Citymapper (UK), Moovit (Israel), Teralytics (Switzerland), FiveAI (UK), Streetline (USA). The review of Big Data use cases includes Big Data use cases that have been applied by ports to improve services, by regional authorities and cities to improve traffic and reduce congestion, by public transport authorities to provide better services to commuters and to offer multimodal service etc. More than 30 Big Data use cases are described in detail and more than 15 Big Data applications are presented. Our analysis is complemented with a review of Data portals such as Google Dataset Search, European Data Portal, Data.world, Major national open data portals (Data.gov, Data.gov.uk), TfL’s open data portal and Glasgow Future city project, kaggle etc. Through our study we identify the most important datasets that are being used in the transportation sector and we try to group them into categories.",,RK,TAK,"Very interesting review paper.

","The implementation of a proactive approach to road safety seems to be even more ambitious when VRUs are the target of the investigation. In this case, even the use of a reactive approach is challenging due to the generally higher underreporting of the crashes involving VRUs, above all bicyclists. The chance to access to GPS data is opening new perspective in the management of bicyclists safety on the condition to relate this new information to the safety level of the infrastructure by considering the bicyclist behavior in the definition of critical events. The developing bike sharing systems, as well as the use of third-party applications for navigation during bike riding, is continuously improving the availability of data which can be used to define a robust methodology for identification of critical sites which need to be studied in detail due to the higher/abnormal concentration of critical events. In this framework, the first step is the definition of what a critical event is through the study of the dynamic of motion and of the bicycles trajectories. When traffic conflicts of different severity level happen, the study of the dynamic parameters involving the bicycle motion may provide the answer, by identifying the threshold values for which a typical interaction between road users or road users and infrastructure turn into a critical event. The present research work explores the possibility of using bicycle probe data for the network screening for bicycle safety. Those data need to be treated and filtered to clean them from outliers and eliminate noise in the dynamic parameters. Bikes probe data used in the elaboration are related to the bike sharing system of the city of Krakow and they are used only to assess the methodology and provide a dataset for later studies. The critical bicycles motion dynamic during a critical event are analyzed with computer vision techniques related to real events. The results of the study provide a first step in the use of GPS data for a proactive approach to bicyclists safety, which need to be validated with reliable measures of safety to be considered applicable in large scale such as an entire urban network. Furthermore, the results need to be validated by considering a measure of exposure, which cannot be done here for the lack of data.",,MK,,,2018-11-05 16:46,0/0,,Nowy

","Driver advisory systems (DAS) installed for energy-efficient rail operation should at least lead to the following impacts: improving punctuality, smoother ride, less energy demand and simplification of the driving task. By now it is not possible to determine the capability actually given for DAS operation in forefront of the deployment, neither for a specific track nor for the whole railway network. After testing first DAS approaches within the last years, several systems have been put into regular operation recently. Every time a transport company thinks about the deployment of a DAS they want to pre-estimate impacts of such systems. Transport companies are always interested in cost-benefit-analysis – of course they need to know before costs arise. In this paper we would like to introduce a process of preparation and deployment of DAS as it was developed in meantime since MT-ITS in 2015. We report about best practice and describe typically occurring problems that are on the one hand critical to the methodical manner and on the other hand have to be prevented as a precondition for achieving reliable results as well as acceptable cost-benefit-ratio. Examples will be given. Rail operation is based on a complex system beginning with the physical infrastructure and its geographic characteristics. Furthermore, the vehicle type has additional influence. Operational aspects such as route diversions or the influence of stochastic distribution of alighting and boarding duration (passenger exchange) complicate the modelling of the overall system. Weather influences, possible technical disturbances or vehicle-specific characteristics as well as driver’s personal manner of driving on each single ride can be mentioned as a fourth group: outside influences. As a result none of the rides is identical to another. By now there is no fully qualified model which would allow to asses a certain railway network in its efficiency. For this reason until now in each case DAS was deployed and evaluated afterwards. Essential steps are: 1) Kick-off meetings to include the rail operation manager, team leaders and trainers (high level compliance). 2) Data measurement and recording for the infrastructure, the vehicle types used and the driver’s expert and knowledge (high-quality data models). 3) Development of the HMI together with the customer and its drivers (acceptance). 4) Implementation of the two-stage training process, consisting of the multiplier training by the system provider and a later following DAS focus training given by trainers of the transport company. 5) Execution of test drives: Part of the company's drivers are equipped with first customized configuration or even company specific implementation of the DAS (system awareness). 6) The rollout is carried out by a final software update, communication channels are specified (feedback). 7) During operation log data are written, for instance including the trajectory of the ride (automatic analysis and calibration of the parameters). 8) The amount of log data is used to find new potentials. 9) Finally, regular feedback discussions with the drivers should be established as a continuous process in order to maintain the savings once achieved within the deployment and evaluation phase.",,VN,,,2018-11-06 17:30,0/0,,Nowy
