39,20556404869,"Demand modelling and travel behaviour under ITS, Future mobility data collection for passenger and freight","Deriving on-trip route choices of truck drivers by utilizing Bluetooth data, loop detector data and variable message sign data",OS - oral session,"On important freight corridors, a large share of traffic consists of trucks. Our hypothesis is that these trucks do not always take the fastest route which causes inefficiencies in the traffic system. Therefore, route choice of truck drivers is of interest to transport planners and traffic management authorities. Compared to passenger cars, little attention has been devoted to understand route choices of the truck drivers. Previous studies have either employed stated preference surveys or utilized the Global Positioning System traces (i.e., revealed preference) to understand the route choice of truck drivers. Moreover, the truck driver's response to incidents is only studied within stated preference settings. The main aim of this paper is to model on-trip route choices of the truck drivers in response to the real-time traffic conditions by utilizing Bluetooth data in combination with loop detector data and variable message sign data. Bluetooth data are used to derive route choices of trucks. Since Bluetooth data does not provide information about the mode type, the trucks are inferred from the data by utilizing the Gaussian mixture model based clustering technique. Loop detector data are utilized to derive the travel times of alternative routes and variable message signs data are used for lane closure information. The on-trip route choice model is based on random utility theory where the utility of a route is specified as a linear function of travel distance, instantaneous travel time, travel time unreliability for the route in the past 10 days and lane closures along the route. A skew based indicator is selected to quantify the unreliability of a route. A case study around the ring of Rotterdam in the Netherlands has been carried out by studying the route choices of truck drivers between the port of Rotterdam and the hinterland. The route choices of truck drivers are modelled using the multinomial logit model for 1671 trucks over a period of four weeks from October 2017 to November 2017. The predictive performance of the model is tested by conducting the out of sample validation. The model results indicate that the parameters are of expected signs and truck drivers significantly value travel distance, instantaneous travel time and lane closure information while making their on-trip route choice. About 40% of the trucks do not take the fastest route which implies that measures focussing on the route choice of trucks have potential to reduce their travel times.","The work described in the abstract is a part of the project ""ToGRIP-Grip on Freight Trips"" supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.",VN,,,2018-10-28 18:24,0/0,,Nowy,397,5,0.012594458438287154,ok

There is no structured, uniform assessment method that would give the opportunity to compare the impact of ITS services and their different configurations. In the case of simulation studies, there is no analysis of the impact of ITS service implementation on motorways or expressways on the surrounding road network. The approach presented in the article takes into account the impact of ITS services implementation on alternative routes. The paper presents the methodology for researching the effectiveness of ITS service – ramp metering implementation using transport models and key indicators allowing such an assessment. An approach was used in which the impact of ITS services is analysed using macro, meso and microscopic models. Macro and mesoscopic models allow estimation of the impact of ITS services on the efficiency of transport network operation and constitute the basis of analyses at the microscopic level, which takes into account the behaviour of drivers through the use of car following and lane change models. As part of the analyses, road network test models (for motorways and expressways along with an alternative route) were developed. Test models include road class, network topology, and different traffic intensity. The models were calibrated using real data (data from the traffic measurement station, data measured in the field, traffic distribution data from the VIATOLL charging system) and data from the vehicle simulator. On the basis of research, key indicators of road network efficiency were identified for ITS services that were analysed using road network test models (travel time, travelled distance, delays, number of stops, queues, average speed) as well as traffic safety indicators (surrogate safety measures were applied). In order to verify the results, models of real road systems for motorways and expressways, including real data from the control group, were developed. The obtained results allowed to develop a model using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, which will enable the road manager to choose optimal ITS solutions and make a decision on the appropriateness of implementing ITS service on the planned or existing motorways and expressways.",,MK,,,2018-10-31 15:49,0/0,,Nowy,372,8,0.021505376344086023,acceptable
